      ! \"<h4>Your margins vs. your industry’s are average.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The good\n
      \ news is you have an opportunity for improvement. The bad news is you need
      to improve.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  challenge is to create an excellent margin product
      or service rather than an average\n  one. There is no such thing as a great
      company or a great business that does not\n  have great margins. The two go
      together. You need to begin to innovate and refine\n  your business model to
      grow your margins. The simplest way to do this is to create\n  more unique products
      or services. &quot;Me-too&quot; products do not command great\n  margins. Think
      of ways to add value and uniqueness to your offering. How can you\n  add small
      amounts of cost for large amounts of perceived customer value?</p>\\r\\n<p>You\n
      \ have stayed away from bad competitors which means you are in a somewhat uncrowded\n
      \ niche in the market place. Continue to innovate to stay in those uncrowded
      niches\n  where other competitors haven’t found fertile field yet.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST
      IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>What steps, philosophies,
      and business practices have you\n  used to create your high-margin products
      and services? Don’t get caught up in the\n  specifics of how you did it, stick
      to the high-level philosophies that got you there.\n  Over time, all business
      models erode, as will yours. It will not erode in minutes,\n  weeks, or months.
      It will erode over the course of years or decades. You need to\n  continue to
      innovate your business model, your products, and your services are innovative\n
      \ to keep commanding the high margins that you desire.</p>\\r\\n<p>What new
      products\n  or services can you add to your offerings to make margins even higher?
      What products\n  or services can you withdraw from your offerings to increase
      the overall margin\n  of the company?</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times these marginal
      products and services drain\n  company resources and don’t add to the bottom
      line significantly. Many times companies\n  can run better and more profitably
      simply by reducing products or service offerings,\n  or even firing customers.</p>\\r\\n<p>By
      firing customers, the objective is to not\n  only get away from customers who
      are a pain, but to get away from customers who\n  are draining organizational
      resources. These customers do not provide profit commensurate\n  with the resources
      they consume.</p>\\r\\n<p>It seems you do not have an issue with\n  bad competition.
      You may have the luxury of ignoring bad competition or all competition.\n  Remember
      the old saying, &quot;the fastest way out of business is imitating your\n  competitors.&quot;
      We don’t want to always be looking in the rear view mirror at\n  our competitors.
      With excellent margins and little competition, we should continue\n  to be first
      and focused. But what are our competitors doing that we need to take\n  notice
      of? Does it make sense for us to poach off one of our competitors to head\n
      \ off potentially bad competitors?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Engage\n
      \ in customer analysis and see if any customer needs to be fired to continue
      to grow\n  our margin. See the example below for a starting point.<br />SECOND
      IMAGE</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Brainstorm\n  ideas for creative new products or services
      only if they will be higher margin than\n  existing items.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Make
      a list of product or service offerings that are\n  below average margin and
      consider dropping them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What new customer\n  groups or industries
      can you sell to that will provide additional profitable outlets\n  for your
      products and services.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Consider purchasing a weaker competitor\n
      \ to stave off the creation of a bad competitor.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Guess\n  what the most profitable industry in the Fortune
      500 is? No, it is not oil. It’s\n  insurance. We have a little-known secret
      at The Business Model Institute: everyone\n  should be in the insurance business.
      It isn’t what you think. We don’t want you\n  to sell life insurance. However,
      insurance is nothing more than accepting risk for\n  money. We make customers
      accept transactional risk they would prefer not to take.\n  There are tactics
      to remove this risk and get paid very well.</p>\\r\\n<p>The insurance\n  portion
      of your operation should be the most profitable aspect of your company.\n  We
      will teach you what your plumber knows that can double your margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>Also,\n
      \ we want you to learn what product we all gladly purchase every month (for
      $88 per\n  ounce) that is more expensive than Russian Caviar and has super-high

      Are there dramatic cost saving\n  opportunities? Remember, no margin, no mission.</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      may need to start\n  fresh. You will continue to struggle if you do not raise
      margins. It may be difficult\n  or impossible to modify your existing offerings
      to dramatically raise margins. If\n  this is the case, you may be better off
      to add a new offering rather than modify\n  a flawed one. Many great companies
      were born as small trial divisions of failed\n  companies. Toys'R'Us us was
      a small division of a failed retailer. CarMax was a\n  division of Circuit City.
      Consider introducing a high-margin product or service\n  that could turn into
      a significant portion of your revenue.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>What steps, philosophies and business practices have
      you\n  used to create your best margin products and services? Don’t get caught
      up in the\n  specifics of how you did it, stick to the philosophies that got
      you there. Over\n  time, all business models erode, as will yours. It will not
      be in minutes, weeks\n  or months. It will be over the course of years or decades.
      However, all business\n  models do erode over time. You need to continue to
      innovate your business model,\n  your products, and your services to allow for
      higher margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>What new\n  products or services can you add to
      your offerings to make margins even higher?\n  What products or services can
      you withdraw from your offerings to increase the overall\n  margin of the company?</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times these marginal products and services\n  drain company resources and don’t
      add to the bottom line significantly. Many times\n  companies can run better
      and more profitably simply by reducing products or service\n  offerings, or
      even firing customers.</p>\\r\\n<p>By firing customers, the objective\n  is
      to not only get away from customers who are a pain, but to get away from customers\n
      \ who are draining organizational resources. These customers do not provide
      profit\n  commensurate with the resources they consume.</p>\\r\\n<p>Do you have
      the luxury of\n  ignoring bad competition or all competition? You most likely
      cannot. There’s an\n  old saying in business, the fastest way out of business
      is imitating your competitors.\n  We don’t want to always be looking in the
      rear view mirror at our competitors. Have\n  we been doing this? How much of
      our margin issue is due to bad or excessive competition?\n  How can we differentiate
      ourselves to gently exit this over-competitive market?\n  We are far better
      off to be in a smaller segment wit excellent margins than to be\n  in the “shark-tank”
      fighting for the big part of the market.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Engage\n
      \ in customer analysis and see if any customer needs to be fired to continue
      to grow\n  our margin. See the example below for a starting point.<br />SECOND
      IMAGE</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Brainstorm\n  ideas for creative new products or services
      only if they will be higher margin than\n  existing items.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Make
      a list of product or service offerings that are\n  below average margin and
      consider dropping them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What new customer\n  groups or industries
      can you sell to that will provide additional profitable outlets\n  for your
      products and services.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Consider purchasing a weaker competitor\n
      \ to stave off the creation of a bad competitor.</li> \\r\\n</li>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Guess\n  what the most profitable industry in the Fortune
      500 is? No, it is not oil. It’s\n  insurance. We have a little-known secret
      at The Business Model Institute: everyone\n  should be in the insurance business.
      It isn’t what you think. We don’t want you\n  to sell life insurance. However,
      insurance is nothing more than accepting risk for\n  money. We make customers
      accept transactional risk they would prefer not to take.\n  There are tactics
      to remove this risk and get paid very well.</p>\\r\\n<p>The insurance\n  portion
      of your operation should be the most profitable aspect of your company.\n  We
      will teach you what your plumber knows that can double your margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>Also,\n
      \ we want you to learn what product we all gladly purchase every month (for
      $88 per\n  ounce) that is more expensive than Russian Caviar and has super-high
      margins. You\n  can use this example to create your own version of this super-high
      profit product.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:07:37.062722000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored &quot;low&quot; on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary\n
      \ determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill
      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, we would actually be able
      to accomplish our sales\n  objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars is never
      the problem and the quality\n  of the sales staff is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the\n  salability of the product combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent.\n  Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on building\n  a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST\n  IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      can do a better job ignoring your own opinions and biases regarding\n  &quot;what
      the customer wants, needs and desires.&quot; Instead, listen to the market.\n
      \ You should pay attention to market data, not your own subjective opinions.
      Listening\n  to the market instead of listening to you is a great tactic to
      use to create an\n  easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to
      be sold. However, some products\n  need more selling and others need more marketing
      in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n  the sale. For instance, insurance tends to
      be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n  tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      easiest way to determine whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed
      is to do an exercise I call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example:
      if you could only sell your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would
      happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling
      marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However,
      you have the best sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars.
      What happens to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or
      slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n
      \ not even bad-sales-people selling. However, the best marketing team in the
      world\n  works with your product. You get all those promotional items that you
      currently\n  don’t have: marketing geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific
      marketing technique\n  you can think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales
      go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n  truth, marketing brings prospects
      to your door. When marketing brings people to\n  you they are sometimes fully
      sold, and sometimes only partially sold. For most businesses,\n  marketing partially
      sells prospects and the sales force needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this
      question can be very challenging. However, it will let you know which is more\n
      \ important for your product or service, marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times\n  I see business owners who put too much emphasis on selling, when the
      prerequisite\n  to the sale is really the marketing. In this case, marketing
      needs to be effective\n  in order to make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      second component of easy\n  to sell is filling an unserved or underserved market.
      It’s as simple as comparing\n  the demand for the product or service to how
      many vendors are chasing market share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an
      unserved or underserved market. In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a
      &quot;me too&quot; product, even if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself:
      How would your customers feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your
      customers would experience a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n
      \ your answer is closer to, &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time
      finding\n  another HVAC contractor in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work
      and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product or service
      should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Many times we see an
      outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and perform their &quot;black
      magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just seem to do it. Perhaps
      we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great sales people who move from
      company to company and continue to sell well do\n  so because they are great
      at understanding how to sell products. This does not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit
      presentations. The secret of great sales people is\n  they are great at creating
      a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally,
      without knowing how they do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps,
      perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable
      and repeatable sales process. The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product
      that is easy to sell, is to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales
      process. Since you scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n
      \ repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n
      \ sales process is, can an ideal prospect be identified and defined? If you
      don’t\n  know where to find the people who buy your products, you will not have
      an easy time\n  selling them. Can you simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages,
      or are you trying to\n  search for a needle in a haystack?  Since you scored
      well on this, you probably\n  know the profile of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There
      is an old saying in business,\n  &quot;Find a parade and get in front of it.&quot;
      Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of
      the parade, not behind it. Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year
      life span. You want to be out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it.
      Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n
      \ this happens, prices drop, competition increases, and the market declines.
      These\n  are the markets you not only want to avoid getting into, but want to
      get out of.\n  You always need to be aware of where you are in the product development
      and product\n  life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p>SECOND IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to
      Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n  you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      you analyzing true, unfiltered data\n  that is coming to you, or are you interpreting
      data to be what you want or need\n  it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming
      your sales people for marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you created
      a definable and repeatable sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you in front\n
      \ of the parade or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If you are behind the parade,
      how can\n  you alter the customers you sell to, and the product or service mix
      you offer, so\n  you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is your
      parade coming to an end\n  in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new
      parade to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you looked at your existing
      prospect list and performed an in-depth analysis to\n  determine how you find,
      generate interest from, and sell prospects? Have you gone\n  through your prospect
      list to see if you can create a process for finding more of\n  them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look into your crystal ball three,\n  four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at what the future of your company\n  holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the general environment your company\n  will
      be operating in. What does this environment look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n
      \ the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the local and state economy
      look\n  like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell to look like? Are their
      industries\n  growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology trends exist
      in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you take your predictions of the future
      and capitalize on them? These predictions\n  are how you get in front of the
      parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like\n  this in the Business Model
      Secrets course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty\n  customers. How did
      you generate them as prospects? How did you generate interest\n  from them during
      initial conversations? How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic\n  when analyzing
      this. Don’t drink your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want to\n  believe.
      Think exclusively from the customer’s point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down\n
      \ with your best salespeople and/or your best former salespeople and pick their
      brains.\n  Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to
      tell you, &quot;I\n  don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot;
      This is not true.\n  They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the
      last five big sales they\n  had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and
      search for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that
      information and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable sales process so you can
      elevate the performance of your average, and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n
      \ get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his
      safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted
      by the marketplace,\n  but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer apathy, he created\n  a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole unit with handle\n  and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw the value and came\n  back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,
      a powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce
      reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      with a potential shortcoming of sales\n  talent. Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on\n  building a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST\n  IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      are doing a good job ignoring your own opinions and biases regarding\n  &quot;what
      the customer wants, needs and desires.&quot; Instead, you are listening\n  to
      the market. Great job! You need to pay attention to market data, not your own\n
      \ subjective opinions. Listening to the market instead of listening to you is
      a great\n  tactic to use to create an easy to sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product needs to\n  be sold. However, some products need more selling and others
      need more marketing\n  in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance,
      insurance tends to be sold\n  more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  easiest way to determine whether your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to\n  do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling marketing at all. It all\n  goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you have the best sales force\n  in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What happens to your sales?\n  Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over\n  the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people selling. However,\n
      \ the best marketing team in the world works with your product. You get all
      those\n  promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,
      Web 2.0 strategies,\n  every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented. What happens?\n  Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects\n  to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business owners\n  who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really\n
      \ the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make
      the\n  product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is filling\n  an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is\n  closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC\n  contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times\n  we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black\n  magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem
      to do it. Perhaps we give\n  them more credit than they deserve. Great sales
      people who move from company to\n  company and continue to sell well do so because
      they are great at understanding\n  how to sell products. This does not mean
      they excel at feature/benefit presentations.\n  The secret of great sales people
      is they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  of the truly
      great sales people do it naturally, without knowing how they do it.\n  They
      create a procedure, a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless,\n
      \ which result in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every
      company,\n  if you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create
      a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this,
      you probably have a\n  definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable\n  and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined?\n  If you don’t know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have\n  an easy time selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are\n  you trying to search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this,\n  you probably know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old\n  saying in business, &quot;Find
      a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses\n  that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;
      product are in front of the parade, not behind\n  it. Most products and services
      only have a 20-year life span. You want to be out\n  in front of the growth
      curve, not chasing it. Nothing is worse than being a late\n  entry into a market
      which is maturing. When this happens, prices drop, competition\n  increases,
      and the market declines. These are the markets you not only want to avoid\n
      \ getting into, but want to get out of. You always need to be aware of where
      you are\n  in the product development and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p>SECOND
      IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you
      thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n  you analyzing true, unfiltered
      data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting\n  data to be what you want
      or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming your sales\n  people for
      marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How solid is your definable and repeatable\n
      \ sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Will you continue to be in front of the parade
      or behind\n  it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If you are in danger of getting behind the
      parade, how can you\n  alter the customers which you sell to, and the product
      or service mix you offer,\n  so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is
      your parade coming to an\n  end in the foreseeable future? How can you find
      a new parade to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you looked at your
      existing prospect list and performed an in-depth analysis to\n  determine how
      you find, generate interest from, and sell prospects? Have you gone\n  through
      your prospect list to see if you can create a process for finding more of\n
      \ them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look into your crystal
      ball three,\n  four, or five years into the future. Don’t look at what the future
      of your company\n  holds, but at the future of your industry, and the general
      environment your company\n  will be operating in. What does this environment
      look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the local and state economy look\n  like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers
      you sell to look like? Are their industries\n  growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      technology trends exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you take your
      predictions of the future and capitalize on them? These predictions\n  are how
      you get in front of the parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like\n  this
      in the Business Model Secrets course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty\n
      \ customers. How did you generate them as prospects? How did you generate interest\n
      \ from them during initial conversations? How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic\n
      \ when analyzing this. Don’t drink your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want
      to\n  believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit
      down\n  with your best salespeople and/or your best former salespeople and pick
      their brains.\n  Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll be inclined
      to tell you, &quot;I\n  don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot;
      This is not true.\n  They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the
      last five big sales they\n  had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and
      search for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that
      information and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable sales process so you can
      elevate the performance of your average, and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n
      \ get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his
      safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted
      by the marketplace,\n  but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer apathy, he created\n  a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole unit with handle\n  and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw the value and came\n  back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,
      a powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce
      reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      ! \"<h4>You scored low on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates\n  is quoted as
      saying, &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant\n
      \ company.&quot; A great business cannot run without great people and your business\n
      \ has been successful attracting and retaining top talent. You may have struggled\n
      \ competing with big businesses regarding this. Have you figured out a strategy
      to\n  work without &quot;superstars&quot; yet still have a well-running business?
      This\n  is a &quot;must for many small businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep in mind
      that there is\n  an asset, not list on your balance sheet, called human capital.
      This human capital\n  consists of the worker’s knowledge base, their abilities,
      their relationship with\n  customers, and their ability to execute your business
      plan., All these components\n  add up to the intangible value of those employees
      to your business. The more talented\n  and tenured an employee, the more valuable
      he or she is to your business. You have\n  retained your talented staff after
      spending time, energy and effort to teach them\n  the knowledge necessary which
      to be useful to our business. Talent will flow to\n  its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve out areas where talented people’s best\n  &quot;use&quot;
      is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business\n
      \ enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles
      and\n  the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether they
      want one or\n  not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand
      is what your company\n  &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.
      You want your brand to mean\n  &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot;
      or &quot;delivers on time, every\n  time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to
      be perceived as, &quot;much more expensive\n  than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they
      don’t really care about their customers,&quot;\n  or &quot;they make a mess
      every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES
      mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive
      in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How
      can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n
      \ so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n
      \ King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump
      steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets
      inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another
      model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this
      aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and add powerful new ones.
      Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long
      Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales.
      When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales.
      However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products
      make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small
      businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on
      the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  is
      your Rolodex under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 action steps you can take to augment this\n  intellectual property.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great\n  example of fully leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California\n  Cedar Company needed a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through\n  R&D, they discovered a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue\n  Duraflame log. However,
      they did not stop at the invention of this product. The\n  true intellectual
      property was not how to make the first artificial log; it was\n  using waste
      to make it. In the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.\n  California
      Cedar went to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and significantly\n
      \ undercut their sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term commitment.\n
      \ California Cedar created a business model where they were paid to accept their
      primary\n  raw material. Now that is leveraging intellectual property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most
      companies\n  grossly under estimate their intellectual capital.During this course,
      we will work\n  hard to help you discover, and profit from, your untapped intellectual

      ! \"<h4>You scored below average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ order to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you\n  have too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or\n  if your customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have\n  quality customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      our customers overly price conscious?\n  If customers have their eye on nothing
      but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses\n  to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers who\n  are going to
      attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that cannot\n  be accomplished,
      you are selling a product which the customer perceives as somewhat\n  generic.
      You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding can allow you\n  to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a premium for some\n
      \ attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does not need to
      be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences. For example, all
      the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and
      a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In
      every business\n  relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can
      &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money,
      so they dictate many of the business\n  terms. However, you need to be able
      to dictate many dynamics in the business relationship.\n  If not, you have a
      problem. For many companies, these seemingly insignificant terms\n  add up to
      a large portion of their profits. For instance, many companies have used\n  the
      self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own\n
      \ customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are dictating terms and dramatically\n
      \ lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer,
      so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A small vendor dealing
      with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms in the same way
      as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard some business
      stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen not do business with
      companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers\n  because all the terms are
      dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n  isn’t always
      a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently provides\n  many
      dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large customers, sometimes\n
      \ they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The third consideration
      of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract them compared to their
      lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue or margin.
      Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say that the
      cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average customer stays
      only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product at a 50 % margin
      during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n  vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve\n  this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring\n
      \ the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy places to find customers?\n
      \ Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak brand through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your\n  price or putting extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet<br
      />SECOND\n  IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>Rank your customers by sales in descending order
      putting the best\n  customer first and the worst customer last in order of sales.
      Include several other\n  criteria, including subjective definitions like how
      difficult they are to deal with,\n  how do they tax the organization, what’s
      their sales growth, and what additional\n  demands they have. Do they demand
      excessive discounts even though they pay net 90\n  days? What’s the cost of
      capital associated with carrying their accounts receivable\n  balance versus
      a customer that pays on time or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What you will find\n  after
      running this customer cost analysis is the customer rankings will change.\n
      \ Many people find out that the customer they thought was their fourth best
      is actually\n  their best customer and the one they thought was their best is
      actually their seventh\n  best. This may lead you to some difficult decisions,
      in particular, the need to\n  fire customers. You may find that some customers
      tax the organization to such an\n  extent that you will make more money by not
      selling to them. This is always a difficult\n  realization because most business
      owners are programmed to think that there is no\n  such thing as a bad customer,
      and that anyone who gives you money is a good customer.\n  This is usually true.
      But occasionally, it can be false. I encourage you to do a\n  customer analysis
      annually to see what the true margin provided by each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n
      \ Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets program, we determine
      the extent\n  of your customers’ price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price
      sensitive&quot;\n  it’s almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture
      a scale. If the customer\n  is only going to pay a certain amount, what they
      are saying is, &quot;Based upon\n  the value of features and benefits, I’m going
      to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering\n  price, let’s add value instead.
      This can be a great way to increase the price slightly\n  while providing better
      value to the customer. This extra value may be in the form\n  of a new or modified
      product. For instance, make a premium version of your product.\n  Figure out
      how to add features, benefits, and attributes and see if that product\n  will
      command a higher price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium ice cream is a great example. Regular\n
      \ ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the
      ice cream\n  market twenty years ago. Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered
      as a tiny\n  segment of the market. These were more expensive, higher-margin
      products. Before\n  long, premium ice cream became a very large segment of the
      total ice cream market.\n  You never know what is going to happen with a segment
      or brand. It could explode.\n  Who would have figured that Starbucks would have
      nearly 50% of the coffee market\n  when you can get a similar cup of coffee
      down the street at McDonalds for a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored low on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates\n  is quoted as
      saying, &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant\n
      \ company.&quot; A great business cannot run without great people and your business\n
      \ has been successful attracting and retaining top talent. You may have struggled\n
      \ competing with big businesses regarding this. Have you figured out a strategy
      to\n  work without &quot;superstars&quot; yet still have a well-running business?
      This\n  is a &quot;must for many small businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep in mind
      that there is\n  an asset, not list on your balance sheet, called human capital.
      This human capital\n  consists of the worker’s knowledge base, their abilities,
      their relationship with\n  customers, and their ability to execute your business
      plan., All these components\n  add up to the intangible value of those employees
      to your business. The more talented\n  and tenured an employee, the more valuable
      he or she is to your business. You have\n  retained your talented staff after
      spending time, energy and effort to teach them\n  the knowledge necessary which
      to be useful to our business. Talent will flow to\n  its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve out areas where talented people’s best\n  &quot;use&quot;
      is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business\n
      \ enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles
      and\n  the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether they
      want one or\n  not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand
      is what your company\n  &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.
      You want your brand to mean\n  &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot;
      or &quot;delivers on time, every\n  time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to
      be perceived as, &quot;much more expensive\n  than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they
      don’t really care about their customers,&quot;\n  or &quot;they make a mess
      every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES
      mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive
      in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How
      can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n
      \ so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n
      \ King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump
      steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets
      inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another
      model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this
      aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and add powerful new ones.
      Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long
      Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales.
      When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales.
      However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products
      make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small
      businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on
      the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  is
      your Rolodex under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 action steps you can take to augment this\n  intellectual property.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great\n  example of fully leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California\n  Cedar Company needed a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through\n  R&D, they discovered a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue\n  Duraflame log. However,
      they did not stop at the invention of this product. The\n  true intellectual
      property was not how to make the first artificial log; it was\n  using waste
      to make it. In the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.\n  California
      Cedar went to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and significantly\n
      \ undercut their sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term commitment.\n
      \ California Cedar created a business model where they were paid to accept their
      primary\n  raw material. Now that is leveraging intellectual property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most
      companies\n  grossly under estimate their intellectual capital.During this course,
      we will work\n  hard to help you discover, and profit from, your untapped intellectual
      capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-18 00:44:49.399686000Z\nupdated_at: 2011-11-21

      ! \"<h4>You scored below average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ order to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you\n  have too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or\n  if your customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have\n  quality customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      our customers overly price conscious?\n  If customers have their eye on nothing
      but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses\n  to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers who\n  are going to
      attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that cannot\n  be accomplished,
      you are selling a product which the customer perceives as somewhat\n  generic.
      You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding can allow you\n  to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a premium for some\n
      \ attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does not need to
      be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences. For example, all
      the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and
      a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In
      every business\n  relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can
      &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money,
      so they dictate many of the business\n  terms. However, you need to be able
      to dictate many dynamics in the business relationship.\n  If not, you have a
      problem. For many companies, these seemingly insignificant terms\n  add up to
      a large portion of their profits. For instance, many companies have used\n  the
      self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own\n
      \ customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are dictating terms and dramatically\n
      \ lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer,
      so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A small vendor dealing
      with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms in the same way
      as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard some business
      stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen not do business with
      companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers\n  because all the terms are
      dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n  isn’t always
      a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently provides\n  many
      dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large customers, sometimes\n
      \ they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The third consideration
      of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract them compared to their
      lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue or margin.
      Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say that the
      cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average customer stays
      only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product at a 50 % margin
      during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n  vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve\n  this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring\n
      \ the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy places to find customers?\n
      \ Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak brand through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your\n  price or putting extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet<br
      />SECOND\n  IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>Rank your customers by sales in descending order
      putting the best\n  customer first and the worst customer last in order of sales.
      Include several other\n  criteria, including subjective definitions like how
      difficult they are to deal with,\n  how do they tax the organization, what’s
      their sales growth, and what additional\n  demands they have. Do they demand
      excessive discounts even though they pay net 90\n  days? What’s the cost of
      capital associated with carrying their accounts receivable\n  balance versus
      a customer that pays on time or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What you will find\n  after
      running this customer cost analysis is the customer rankings will change.\n
      \ Many people find out that the customer they thought was their fourth best
      is actually\n  their best customer and the one they thought was their best is
      actually their seventh\n  best. This may lead you to some difficult decisions,
      in particular, the need to\n  fire customers. You may find that some customers
      tax the organization to such an\n  extent that you will make more money by not
      selling to them. This is always a difficult\n  realization because most business
      owners are programmed to think that there is no\n  such thing as a bad customer,
      and that anyone who gives you money is a good customer.\n  This is usually true.
      But occasionally, it can be false. I encourage you to do a\n  customer analysis
      annually to see what the true margin provided by each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n
      \ Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets program, we determine
      the extent\n  of your customers’ price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price
      sensitive&quot;\n  it’s almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture
      a scale. If the customer\n  is only going to pay a certain amount, what they
      are saying is, &quot;Based upon\n  the value of features and benefits, I’m going
      to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering\n  price, let’s add value instead.
      This can be a great way to increase the price slightly\n  while providing better
      value to the customer. This extra value may be in the form\n  of a new or modified
      product. For instance, make a premium version of your product.\n  Figure out
      how to add features, benefits, and attributes and see if that product\n  will
      command a higher price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium ice cream is a great example. Regular\n
      \ ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the
      ice cream\n  market twenty years ago. Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered
      as a tiny\n  segment of the market. These were more expensive, higher-margin
      products. Before\n  long, premium ice cream became a very large segment of the
      total ice cream market.\n  You never know what is going to happen with a segment
      or brand. It could explode.\n  Who would have figured that Starbucks would have
      nearly 50% of the coffee market\n  when you can get a similar cup of coffee
      down the street at McDonalds for a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>Your margins vs. your industry are low.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your challenge\n
      \ is to create dramatically improve your margins. There is no such thing as
      a great\n  company that does not have great margins. The two go together. You
      need to begin\n  to innovate and refine your business model to grow your margins.
      You may have bad\n  competitors crowding the marketplace and eroding your margin.
      Can you differentiate\n  your product to command higher margins? What additional
      value or features can you\n  add to the offering to allow you to charge more?
      Are there dramatic cost saving\n  opportunities? Remember, no margin, no mission.</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      may need to start\n  fresh. You will continue to struggle if you do not raise
      margins. It may be difficult\n  or impossible to modify your existing offerings
      to dramatically raise margins. If\n  this is the case, you may be better off
      to add a new offering rather than modify\n  a flawed one. Many great companies
      were born as small trial divisions of failed\n  companies. Toys'R'Us us was
      a small division of a failed retailer. CarMax was a\n  division of Circuit City.
      Consider introducing a high-margin product or service\n  that could turn into
      a significant portion of your revenue.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>What steps, philosophies and business practices have
      you\n  used to create your best margin products and services? Don’t get caught
      up in the\n  specifics of how you did it, stick to the philosophies that got
      you there. Over\n  time, all business models erode, as will yours. It will not
      be in minutes, weeks\n  or months. It will be over the course of years or decades.
      However, all business\n  models do erode over time. You need to continue to
      innovate your business model,\n  your products, and your services to allow for
      higher margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>What new\n  products or services can you add to
      your offerings to make margins even higher?\n  What products or services can
      you withdraw from your offerings to increase the overall\n  margin of the company?</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times these marginal products and services\n  drain company resources and don’t
      add to the bottom line significantly. Many times\n  companies can run better
      and more profitably simply by reducing products or service\n  offerings, or
      even firing customers.</p>\\r\\n<p>By firing customers, the objective\n  is
      to not only get away from customers who are a pain, but to get away from customers\n
      \ who are draining organizational resources. These customers do not provide
      profit\n  commensurate with the resources they consume.</p>\\r\\n<p>Do you have
      the luxury of\n  ignoring bad competition or all competition? You most likely
      cannot. There’s an\n  old saying in business, the fastest way out of business
      is imitating your competitors.\n  We don’t want to always be looking in the
      rear view mirror at our competitors. Have\n  we been doing this? How much of
      our margin issue is due to bad or excessive competition?\n  How can we differentiate
      ourselves to gently exit this over-competitive market?\n  We are far better
      off to be in a smaller segment wit excellent margins than to be\n  in the “shark-tank”
      fighting for the big part of the market.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Engage\n
      \ in customer analysis and see if any customer needs to be fired to continue
      to grow\n  our margin. See the example below for a starting point.<br />SECOND
      IMAGE</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Brainstorm\n  ideas for creative new products or services
      only if they will be higher margin than\n  existing items.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Make
      a list of product or service offerings that are\n  below average margin and
      consider dropping them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What new customer\n  groups or industries
      can you sell to that will provide additional profitable outlets\n  for your
      products and services.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Consider purchasing a weaker competitor\n
      \ to stave off the creation of a bad competitor.</li> \\r\\n</li>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Guess\n  what the most profitable industry in the Fortune
      500 is? No, it is not oil. It’s\n  insurance. We have a little-known secret
      at The Business Model Institute: everyone\n  should be in the insurance business.
      It isn’t what you think. We don’t want you\n  to sell life insurance. However,
      insurance is nothing more than accepting risk for\n  money. We make customers
      accept transactional risk they would prefer not to take.\n  There are tactics
      to remove this risk and get paid very well.</p>\\r\\n<p>The insurance\n  portion
      of your operation should be the most profitable aspect of your company.\n  We
      will teach you what your plumber knows that can double your margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>Also,\n
      \ we want you to learn what product we all gladly purchase every month (for
      $88 per\n  ounce) that is more expensive than Russian Caviar and has super-high
      margins. You\n  can use this example to create your own version of this super-high
      profit product.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:07:37.062722000Z\nupdated_at:

      sell product\n  account for over one half of the total score. Significant research
      has gone into\n  this scoring process to assess your business model with the
      greatest accuracy. Remember\n  that your competitors are actively working to
      improve there competitive position\n  and therefore business models erode over
      time. No matter what your score, your best\n  source of competitive advantage
      is to be continually actively working to refine\n  and improve your business
      model.</p>\\r\\nPIE CHART GOES HERE\\r\\n<p>In the past, you\n  may not have
      given much thought to your business model. Most business books teach\n  us that
      our business plan is the most important tool for managing our business success.\n
      \ However, a stellar business plan is not much good without a solid business
      model\n  behind it.</p>\\r\\n<div style=\\\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;

      \ Our model uses a scientific, objective approach to grading an existing business\n

      ! \"<h4>You scored average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Most business owners\n
      \ have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their working lives
      are spent\n  in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs to be a significant
      asset for\n  you and your family. I believe every business owner should be able
      to sell their\n  business for a financially meaningful sum.  That sum is to
      be defined by you. It\n  needs to be enough so you will never need to work again
      if you do not want to. Let’s\n  say the amount is $50 million.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      you put your business up for sale today,\n  could you sell it for that? Most
      business owners think their businesses are worth\n  more than they actually
      are. Here is an exercise I suggest you do.</p>\\r\\nI<p>magine\n  I work for
      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50 million to buy businesses.\n  You
      and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business right now. I’m going to\n
      \ pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business for, $5 million,\n
      \ $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank. You have
      a party;\n  you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST\n
      \ IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>The CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The
      CEO Emeritus\n  creates a business that runs very well without their direct
      daily input. The CEO\n  Emeritus works the hours that she wants to work, gets
      paid a terrific salary (what\n  you earn right now or maybe more), does work
      that she wants to do, and performs\n  activities only an owner can; like being
      the head cheerleader, the visionary, the\n  strategist, the keeper of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We\n  call the CEO Emeritus Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets\n  Advanced Course covers
      The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the\n  Standard Bearer
      is the person that maintains the level of how well the organization\n  performs
      all work. Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are\n  in
      the building versus when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic at
      work.\n  It’s not that you are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present.\n  Your people know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the\n  standard is an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally\n  well, hundreds or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time.\n  The reason is that the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities\n  which only the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million\n  check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      do you need to do to tweak your business\n  model so your business is worth
      $20 million? Focus on number one and number two\n  of the &quot;A&quot; categories
      (excellent margins and easy to sell) of Business\n  Model Secrets. If you have
      excellent margins and a product that’s easy to sell,\n  you are well on your
      way to creating a powerful business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you\n  are serious
      about selling your business in the next two or three years, go to a\n  business
      broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money for a business assessment;\n
      \ it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what someone will pay for
      it.\n  The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people pay too much
      for businesses,\n  and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment
      says their business is\n  worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend
      spending five or ten thousand\n  dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business.
      However, it’s a good exercise\n  to go to a business broker and talk to someone
      who buys and sells businesses all\n  day. Let them tell you how saleable your
      business is. They may have some tips to\n  get your business more saleable and
      get a fair market assessment on the value of\n  your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we focus extensively
      on the techniques needed to become a CEO Emeritus.\n  Once you have achieved
      Emeritus status, you might not want to sell your business.\n  In our opinion,
      CEO Emeritus is the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge\n  with clients
      is getting them to believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week\n  and
      make more than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be
      used\n  for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror
      stories\n  about someone who bought a business and it went badly. Bad purchases
      done poorly\n  go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will discuss
      criteria for a\n  good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next
      level.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:51:20.455178000Z\nupdated_at: 2011-11-22

      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, we would actually be able
      to accomplish our sales\n  objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars is never
      the problem and the quality\n  of the sales staff is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the\n  salability of the product combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent.\n  Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on building\n  a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST\n  IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      can do a better job ignoring your own opinions and biases regarding\n  &quot;what
      the customer wants, needs and desires.&quot; Instead, listen to the market.\n
      \ You should pay attention to market data, not your own subjective opinions.
      Listening\n  to the market instead of listening to you is a great tactic to
      use to create an\n  easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to
      be sold. However, some products\n  need more selling and others need more marketing
      in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n  the sale. For instance, insurance tends to
      be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n  tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      easiest way to determine whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed
      is to do an exercise I call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example:
      if you could only sell your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would
      happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling
      marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However,
      you have the best sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars.
      What happens to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or
      slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n
      \ not even bad-sales-people selling. However, the best marketing team in the
      world\n  works with your product. You get all those promotional items that you
      currently\n  don’t have: marketing geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific
      marketing technique\n  you can think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales
      go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n  truth, marketing brings prospects
      to your door. When marketing brings people to\n  you they are sometimes fully
      sold, and sometimes only partially sold. For most businesses,\n  marketing partially
      sells prospects and the sales force needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this
      question can be very challenging. However, it will let you know which is more\n
      \ important for your product or service, marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times\n  I see business owners who put too much emphasis on selling, when the
      prerequisite\n  to the sale is really the marketing. In this case, marketing
      needs to be effective\n  in order to make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      second component of easy\n  to sell is filling an unserved or underserved market.
      It’s as simple as comparing\n  the demand for the product or service to how
      many vendors are chasing market share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an
      unserved or underserved market. In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a
      &quot;me too&quot; product, even if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself:
      How would your customers feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your
      customers would experience a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n
      \ your answer is closer to, &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time
      finding\n  another HVAC contractor in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work
      and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product or service
      should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Many times we see an
      outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and perform their &quot;black
      magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just seem to do it. Perhaps
      we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great sales people who move from
      company to company and continue to sell well do\n  so because they are great
      at understanding how to sell products. This does not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit
      presentations. The secret of great sales people is\n  they are great at creating
      a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally,
      without knowing how they do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps,
      perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable
      and repeatable sales process. The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product
      that is easy to sell, is to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales
      process. Since you scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n
      \ repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n

      don’t\n  know where to find the people who buy your products, you will not have
      an easy time\n  selling them. Can you simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages,
      or are you trying to\n  search for a needle in a haystack?  Since you scored
      well on this, you probably\n  know the profile of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There
      is an old saying in business,\n  &quot;Find a parade and get in front of it.&quot;
      Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of
      the parade, not behind it. Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year
      life span. You want to be out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it.
      Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n
      \ this happens, prices drop, competition increases, and the market declines.
      These\n  are the markets you not only want to avoid getting into, but want to
      get out of.\n  You always need to be aware of where you are in the product development
      and product\n  life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p>SECOND IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to
      Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n  you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      you analyzing true, unfiltered data\n  that is coming to you, or are you interpreting
      data to be what you want or need\n  it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming
      your sales people for marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you created
      a definable and repeatable sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you in front\n
      \ of the parade or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If you are behind the parade,
      how can\n  you alter the customers you sell to, and the product or service mix
      you offer, so\n  you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is your
      parade coming to an end\n  in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new
      parade to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you looked at your existing
      prospect list and performed an in-depth analysis to\n  determine how you find,
      generate interest from, and sell prospects? Have you gone\n  through your prospect
      list to see if you can create a process for finding more of\n  them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look into your crystal ball three,\n  four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at what the future of your company\n  holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the general environment your company\n  will
      be operating in. What does this environment look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n
      \ the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the local and state economy
      look\n  like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell to look like? Are their
      industries\n  growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology trends exist
      in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you take your predictions of the future
      and capitalize on them? These predictions\n  are how you get in front of the
      parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like\n  this in the Business Model
      Secrets course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty\n  customers. How did
      you generate them as prospects? How did you generate interest\n  from them during
      initial conversations? How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic\n  when analyzing
      this. Don’t drink your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want to\n  believe.
      Think exclusively from the customer’s point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down\n
      \ with your best salespeople and/or your best former salespeople and pick their
      brains.\n  Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to
      tell you, &quot;I\n  don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot;
      This is not true.\n  They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the
      last five big sales they\n  had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and
      search for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that
      information and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable sales process so you can
      elevate the performance of your average, and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n
      \ get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his
      safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted
      by the marketplace,\n  but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer apathy, he created\n  a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole unit with handle\n  and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw the value and came\n  back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,
      a powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce
      reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      ! \"<h4>You scored well on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary determinant\n
      \ of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill can sell
      a reasonable\n  amount of the product or service. The salesperson should not
      have to sell ice to\n  Eskimos. Many times business owners think, &quot;If we
      could just get some sales\n  superstars in here, we would actually be able to
      accomplish our sales objectives.&quot;\n  A lack of sales superstars is never
      the problem and the quality of the sales staff\n  is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the salability of the product\n  combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent. Since you have a highly sellable\n  product,
      you can focus your attention on building a strong sales and marketing process\n
      \ to amplify the product’s salability.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      are doing\n  a pretty good job ignoring your own opinions and biases regarding
      &quot;what the\n  customer wants, needs and desires.&quot; Instead, you are
      listening to the market.\n  Great job! You need to pay attention to market data,
      not your own subjective opinions.\n  Listening to the market instead of listening
      to yourself is a great tactic to use\n  to create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product needs to be sold. However,\n  some products need more selling and others
      need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n  the sale. For instance,
      insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n  tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine whether\n  your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could only sell your product and were\n  allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n
      \ nothing resembling marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your
      sales\n  force. However, you have the best sales force in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing\n  but superstars. What happens to your sales? Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n  not even bad-sales-people selling.
      However, the best marketing team in the world\n  works with your product. You
      get all those promotional items that you currently\n  don’t have: marketing
      geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique\n  you can
      think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ truth, marketing brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to\n  you they are sometimes fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses,\n  marketing partially sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this question can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more\n  important for your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times\n  I see business owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite\n  to the sale is really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective\n  in order to
      make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy\n  to
      sell is filling an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing\n
      \ the demand for the product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself: How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your customers would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n  your answer is closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding\n  another HVAC contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product or service should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process.
      Many times we see an outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and
      perform their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just
      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does
      not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great
      sales people is\n  they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally, without knowing how they
      do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones,
      but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable and repeatable sales process.
      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is
      to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales process. Since you
      scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n  repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A

      you are\n  in the product development and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p>SECOND
      IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you
      thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n  you analyzing true, unfiltered
      data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting\n  data to be what you want
      or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming your sales\n  people for
      marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How solid is your definable and repeatable\n
      \ sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Will you continue to be in front of the parade
      or behind\n  it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If you are in danger of getting behind the
      parade, how can you\n  alter the customers which you sell to, and the product
      or service mix you offer,\n  so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is
      your parade coming to an\n  end in the foreseeable future? How can you find
      a new parade to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you looked at your
      existing prospect list and performed an in-depth analysis to\n  determine how
      you find, generate interest from, and sell prospects? Have you gone\n  through
      your prospect list to see if you can create a process for finding more of\n
      \ them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look into your crystal
      ball three,\n  four, or five years into the future. Don’t look at what the future
      of your company\n  holds, but at the future of your industry, and the general
      environment your company\n  will be operating in. What does this environment
      look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the local and state economy look\n  like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers
      you sell to look like? Are their industries\n  growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      technology trends exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you take your
      predictions of the future and capitalize on them? These predictions\n  are how
      you get in front of the parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like\n  this
      in the Business Model Secrets course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty\n
      \ customers. How did you generate them as prospects? How did you generate interest\n
      \ from them during initial conversations? How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic\n
      \ when analyzing this. Don’t drink your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want
      to\n  believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit
      down\n  with your best salespeople and/or your best former salespeople and pick
      their brains.\n  Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll be inclined
      to tell you, &quot;I\n  don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot;
      This is not true.\n  They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the
      last five big sales they\n  had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and
      search for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that
      information and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable sales process so you can
      elevate the performance of your average, and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n
      \ get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his
      safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted
      by the marketplace,\n  but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer apathy, he created\n  a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole unit with handle\n  and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw the value and came\n  back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,
      a powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce
      reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      ! \"<h4>You scored low on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates\n  is quoted as
      saying, &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant\n
      \ company.&quot; A great business cannot run without great people and your business\n
      \ has been successful attracting and retaining top talent. You may have struggled\n
      \ competing with big businesses regarding this. Have you figured out a strategy
      to\n  work without &quot;superstars&quot; yet still have a well-running business?
      This\n  is a &quot;must for many small businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep in mind
      that there is\n  an asset, not list on your balance sheet, called human capital.
      This human capital\n  consists of the worker’s knowledge base, their abilities,
      their relationship with\n  customers, and their ability to execute your business
      plan., All these components\n  add up to the intangible value of those employees
      to your business. The more talented\n  and tenured an employee, the more valuable
      he or she is to your business. You have\n  retained your talented staff after
      spending time, energy and effort to teach them\n  the knowledge necessary which
      to be useful to our business. Talent will flow to\n  its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve out areas where talented people’s best\n  &quot;use&quot;
      is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business\n
      \ enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles
      and\n  the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether they
      want one or\n  not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand
      is what your company\n  &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.
      You want your brand to mean\n  &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot;
      or &quot;delivers on time, every\n  time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to
      be perceived as, &quot;much more expensive\n  than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they
      don’t really care about their customers,&quot;\n  or &quot;they make a mess
      every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES
      mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive
      in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How
      can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n
      \ so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n
      \ King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump
      steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets
      inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another
      model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this
      aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and add powerful new ones.
      Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long
      Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales.
      When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales.
      However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products
      make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small
      businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on
      the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  is
      your Rolodex under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write down
      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital.During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and profit
      from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-18 00:44:49.399686000Z\nupdated_at:

      with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES mean something to your customers.
      Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive in their eyes. You scored well
      on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How can you make it stronger? Brands
      typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n  so be careful not to overextend
      your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n  King underwear, Kellogg’s
      hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump steaks.\n  Instead, create
      a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets inexpensive\n  Chinese-made
      cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another model under the\n  Toyota
      moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect\n
      \ your current brands and add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about
      the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature,
      more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a
      handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales. However, as the market
      matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products make up only 20% of the
      sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small businesses can’t compete
      on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on the Long Tail that we can
      &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>These\n  days, with so
      much global competition and so many options for every customer, there\n  is
      virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition. Excessive competition\n
      \ crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved niche on the Long
      Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used to find an unserved
      or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there was market data on
      some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone. The only way to create
      a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit. Not a stab-in-the-dark
      guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may be blindfolded, but
      you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny clues from your customers,
      vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n  are latent; they won’t jump
      up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM, or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or
      a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed in the\n  idea, despite
      any data, and created something special. You can do the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n

      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual

      ! \"<h4>Congratulations, you scored well on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four\n
      \ capitals are comprised of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial
      capital,\n  human capital and brand capital. Your score is a composite average
      of all four areas.\n  We’ll run through them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual
      Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  high score indicates you have some valuable intellectual
      capital. Every business\n  sells intellectual property. Intellectual property
      isn’t just for doctors, patent\n  attorneys, accountants and chip designers.
      Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual\n  property, business. If you make
      widgets, is it the generic making of the widgets\n  that generates the profit,
      probably not? More likely, it is your proprietary way\n  of making the widgets,
      or your secret vendors, or the way you train your staff that\n  account for
      the profits. These are all examples of intellectual property. The only\n  true
      asset your business has is the ability to generate a profit doing the things\n
      \ you do the way you do them. The little secrets and tricks are what allow you
      to\n  make profits doing the same ordinary thing as the same ordinary company
      next door.\n  The reason you make money is you know a couple of little things
      that enable you\n  to take better care of your customers, buy better, or charge
      a little extra. All\n  the little things are what make up your intellectual
      property and what contribute\n  extensively to your bottom line. Therefore,
      the more you can grow your intellectual\n  property, the more intellectual capital
      you will have and the more profit you will\n  make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts
      and connections are intellectual property. Look at\n  your Rolodex and figure
      out what a contact in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these\n  contacts are worth
      quite a bit. Unfortunately, for most of us, many of the contacts\n  in a Rolodex
      cannot be measured in monetary terms. These folks may be great friends,\n  great
      customers, whatever. However, they don’t necessarily add to your bottom line.\n
      \ Though these people cannot be translated directly into money, they are incredibly\n
      \ valuable to you and your business. If you lose the relationship with them,
      you can\n  certainly attach a negative dollar value on the loss. For instance,
      what is the\n  value of the purchasing agent at your best customer who genuinely
      likes you? What\n  is the value of your old college roommate who calls you once
      a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;\n  but introduces you to some great vendors? What
      are you doing to nurture and grow\n  those relationships? What are you doing
      to better utilize people who could be more\n  helpful to you? There are people
      that know, like, and trust you who may not be adding\n  value to you or your
      business simply because you have not asked. Is there a way\n  that you can leverage
      the long-term relationships you have with these people and\n  turn them into
      a valuable business asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex\n  capital?
      What new Rolodex capital needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve\n
      \ heard the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital.
      This is\n  true not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to
      have an appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize
      on opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than
      just having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point. In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well,\n  your margins
      should be funding your growth vs. constantly having to borrow money.\n  Debt
      is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate amount of debt for any\n
      \ business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Continue your financial diligence and
      use\n  debt as a weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong?\n  If not, what can you do with your financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance,\n  a manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot;\n  the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments.\n  He used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things you can do\n  that your financially weaker
      competitors cannot because of their financial status.\n  Consider doing one
      or more of these things to create a competitive &quot;moat&quot;\n  to protect
      you from your competition.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates\n
      \ has said, &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant
      company.&quot;\n  A great business cannot run without great people. You have
      been successful at attracting\n  and retaining top talent. You have done a good
      job competing with big businesses\n  in regard to this. Alternatively, you may
      have figured out a strategy that enables\n  you to work without &quot;superstars,&quot;
      yet still have a well-run business.\n  Keep in mind there is an asset not listed
      on your balance sheet called human capital.\n  This human capital consists of
      workers’ knowledge base, their abilities, their relationships\n  with customers,
      and their ability to execute your business plan. All these components\n  add
      up to the value of these employees to your business. The more talented and tenured\n
      \ an employee, the more valuable he or she is. You have retained your talented
      staff\n  after spending time, energy, and effort to teach them what is necessary
      to be useful\n  to your business. Talent will flow to its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve\n  out areas where talented people’s best use is working for
      you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand\n  Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business enterprises
      feel that &quot;branding&quot;\n  is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles and the Gillettes
      of the world. Every business\n  has a brand, whether they want one or not. A
      brand does not need to be overly complicated.\n  A brand is what your company
      &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.\n  You want your brand
      to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers\n  on
      time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much\n
      \ more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they don’t really care about
      their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess every time we place an order
      with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES mean something to your customers.

      ! \"<h4>You scored below average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ order to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you\n  have too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or\n  if your customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have\n  quality customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      our customers overly price conscious?\n  If customers have their eye on nothing
      but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses\n  to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers who\n  are going to
      attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that cannot\n  be accomplished,
      you are selling a product which the customer perceives as somewhat\n  generic.
      You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding can allow you\n  to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a premium for some\n
      \ attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does not need to
      be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences. For example, all
      the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and
      a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In
      every business\n  relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can
      &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money,
      so they dictate many of the business\n  terms. However, you need to be able
      to dictate many dynamics in the business relationship.\n  If not, you have a
      problem. For many companies, these seemingly insignificant terms\n  add up to
      a large portion of their profits. For instance, many companies have used\n  the
      self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own\n
      \ customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are dictating terms and dramatically\n
      \ lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer,
      so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A small vendor dealing
      with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms in the same way
      as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard some business
      stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen not do business with
      companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers\n  because all the terms are
      dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n  isn’t always
      a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently provides\n  many
      dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large customers, sometimes\n
      \ they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The third consideration
      of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract them compared to their
      lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue or margin.
      Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say that the
      cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average customer stays
      only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product at a 50 % margin
      during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n  vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve\n  this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring\n
      \ the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy places to find customers?\n
      \ Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak brand through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your\n  price or putting extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is

      the best\n  customer first and the worst customer last in order of sales. Include
      several other\n  criteria, including subjective definitions like how difficult
      they are to deal with,\n  how do they tax the organization, what’s their sales
      growth, and what additional\n  demands they have. Do they demand excessive discounts
      even though they pay net 90\n  days? What’s the cost of capital associated with
      carrying their accounts receivable\n  balance versus a customer that pays on
      time or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What you will find\n  after running this customer
      cost analysis is the customer rankings will change.\n  Many people find out
      that the customer they thought was their fourth best is actually\n  their best
      customer and the one they thought was their best is actually their seventh\n
      \ best. This may lead you to some difficult decisions, in particular, the need
      to\n  fire customers. You may find that some customers tax the organization
      to such an\n  extent that you will make more money by not selling to them. This
      is always a difficult\n  realization because most business owners are programmed
      to think that there is no\n  such thing as a bad customer, and that anyone who
      gives you money is a good customer.\n  This is usually true. But occasionally,
      it can be false. I encourage you to do a\n  customer analysis annually to see
      what the true margin provided by each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we determine the extent\n  of your customers’
      price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot;\n  it’s
      almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer\n
      \ is only going to pay a certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based
      upon\n  the value of features and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather
      than just lowering\n  price, let’s add value instead. This can be a great way
      to increase the price slightly\n  while providing better value to the customer.
      This extra value may be in the form\n  of a new or modified product. For instance,
      make a premium version of your product.\n  Figure out how to add features, benefits,
      and attributes and see if that product\n  will command a higher price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular\n  ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream\n  market twenty years ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny\n  segment of the market.
      These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before\n  long, premium ice
      cream became a very large segment of the total ice cream market.\n  You never
      know what is going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode.\n  Who
      would have figured that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market\n
      \ when you can get a similar cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\\r\\n\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored above average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>FIRST IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ order to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you\n  have too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or\n  if your customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have\n  quality customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even
      though you have quality customers,\n  are they still price conscious? If customers
      have their eye on nothing but price,\n  it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to remain profitable. Ideally, what needs\n  to be done is to find the customers
      who are going to attribute value to something,\n  other than sales price. If
      that cannot be accomplished, you are selling a product\n  which the customer
      perceives as somewhat generic. You need to work on your brand\n  to overcome
      this. Branding can allow you to attack a different segment of the marketplace,\n
      \ and charge a premium for some attribute other than the generic product. This
      attribute\n  does not need to be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences.
      For example,\n  all the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You
      squeeze a tube and\n  a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands
      exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In\n  every business relationship,
      one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate\n  terms.&quot; Can
      you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate\n  many of the
      business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics\n  in
      the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies, these\n
      \ seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance,\n  many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web
      to &quot;force&quot;\n  customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating\n  terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this
      is a minor &quot;term&quot;\n  to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor\n  dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same\n  way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business\n  stories about vendors that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies\n  like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers\n  are not quality customers because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A\n  quality customer
      isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently\n
      \ provides many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers,\n  sometimes they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration\n  of quality customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime\n  value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are\n  in a business with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a\n  new customer is $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell,\n  on average, $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend\n  half the lifetime value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario,\n  the cost of attraction
      vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer\n  is horrible. To
      improve this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower\n  the cost
      of acquiring the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There\n
      \ are several questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy places to find customers?\n
      \ Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak brand through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your\n  price or putting extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      Probably several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n

      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p>SECOND\n
      \ IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>Rank your customers by sales in descending order putting
      the best\n  customer first and the worst customer last in order of sales. Include
      several other\n  criteria, including subjective definitions like how difficult
      they are to deal with,\n  how do they tax the organization, what’s their sales
      growth, and what additional\n  demands they have. Do they demand excessive discounts
      even though they pay net 90\n  days? What’s the cost of capital associated with
      carrying their accounts receivable\n  balance versus a customer that pays on
      time or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What you will find\n  after running this customer
      cost analysis is the customer rankings will change.\n  Many people find out
      that the customer they thought was their fourth best is actually\n  their best
      customer and the one they thought was their best is actually their seventh\n
      \ best. This may lead you to some difficult decisions, in particular, the need
      to\n  fire customers. You may find that some customers tax the organization
      to such an\n  extent that you will make more money by not selling to them. This
      is always a difficult\n  realization because most business owners are programmed
      to think that there is no\n  such thing as a bad customer, and that anyone who
      gives you money is a good customer.\n  This is usually true. But occasionally,
      it can be false. I encourage you to do a\n  customer analysis annually to see
      what the true margin provided by each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we determine the extent\n  of your customers’
      price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot;\n  it’s
      almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer\n
      \ is only going to pay a certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based
      upon\n  the value of features and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather
      than just lowering\n  price, let’s add value instead. This can be a great way
      to increase the price slightly\n  while providing better value to the customer.
      This extra value may be in the form\n  of a new or modified product. For instance,
      make a premium version of your product.\n  Figure out how to add features, benefits,
      and attributes and see if that product\n  will command a higher price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular\n  ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream\n  market twenty years ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny\n  segment of the market.
      These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before\n  long, premium ice
      cream became a very large segment of the total ice cream market.\n  You never
      know what is going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode.\n  Who
      would have figured that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market\n
      \ when you can get a similar cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:34:15.723682000Z\nupdated_at: 2011-11-22

      The\n  Pet Rock type product is a great product for one-person company. You
      make a ton\n  of money and then retire. However, you are trying to build a larger

      live in the Midwest\n  where there are many ethanol refineries. They came into
      existence at a cost of hundreds\n  of millions of dollars each. Then, the price
      of oil dropped dramatically and this\n  industry became nonviable without additional
      government subsidies. These subsidies\n  never did occur and many of these ethanol
      plants are being shut down before ever\n  coming online. The longevity of the
      industry was not sustainable without the high\n  price of oil.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your
      industry may not be around for a long time. I am not\n  advocating changing
      the business you are in. Once you are in a certain business,\n  you are stuck,
      right? That is partially true, but not entirely. For example, think\n  about
      IBM. How do you define their business? If you define their business as a provider\n
      \ of equipment and automation for office workers, their business hasn’t changed
      much\n  over the years. But when you remember that IBM started in office machines,
      then\n  typewriters, then computers, and then service delivery, they have done
      an excellent\n  job of morphing their business model over the years. They were
      constantly shifting\n  into industries and sub-businesses that were growing.</p>\\r\\n<p>All
      businesses can\n  do this if they are open to change. It begins with subtly
      changing the SIC code\n  of the industry you are in. In the 1850s people traveled
      cross country via railroad.\n  Railroads were the people movers. Then in the
      1920s and 1930s the airline industry\n  was beginning and the railroads saw
      themselves as a railroad and not a people mover.\n  The railroads were flush
      with lots of cash but did nothing to expand into the airline\n  industry because
      in their minds, they were a railroad. If the railroads had seen\n  themselves
      as a people-moving business, they would have jumped into the airline\n  business,
      or perhaps even the automotive industry.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n
      \ average, there are some concerns as to the long-term viability of your industry.\n
      \ Ask yourself, &quot;Are you really an IT services company or do you help companies\n
      \ improve their business process through the use of technology?&quot; Do you
      see yourself\n  as a gadget seller or do you solve a broader customer issue?
      The issue never changes,\n  just what you sell the customer. There’s a bigger
      picture for everything you do.\n  You are always solving a problem for your
      customers. What you currently do is specifically\n  how you solve their problem.
      However, these specifics can change over time. Your\n  opportunities lie in
      expanding your products or services in this strong industry.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Picture it is ten years from now and you are looking
      into\n  your crystal ball. What does the longevity of your business look like
      in ten years?\n  What is the future environment like? Is it better than today,
      or is it worse? How\n  about twenty years from now? Do you still see growth
      and opportunity in your business?\n  If so, you are in great shape. If you have
      some doubts, analyze things from the\n  worst-case perspective. What happens
      if things play out closer to the worst-case\n  scenario rather than your expected
      or hopeful scenario? Can you mitigate or eliminate\n  this risk?</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      can you avoid the mistake the railroads made? Are you in\n  the railroad business
      or are you in the people moving business? What’s the broadest\n  definition
      of what you do? Make it more specific than &quot;we help people.&quot;\n  Exactly
      how do you help your customers? What businesses similar or related to yours\n
      \ help their customers and how do they do it? Are there underserved niches in
      any\n  of these areas? What additional businesses, industries or niches can
      you move into\n  that will help your customers with a similar problem?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action

      in five years your industry\n  will be in very bad shape. You now know you’re

      brick wall. What can you do today to move\n  away from the brick wall so you
      have an even better business five years from now?\n  This may not appear relevant,
      but do the exercise anyway. You need to constantly\n  experiment, and engage
      in small, quick trials that can become the next big winners\n  in your business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now
      my crystal ball says the general condition of your\n  industry is outstanding

      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.

      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST\n
      \ IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>The CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The
      CEO Emeritus\n  creates a business that runs very well without their direct
      daily input. The CEO\n  Emeritus works the hours that she wants to work, gets
      paid a terrific salary (what\n  you earn right now or maybe more), does work
      that she wants to do, and performs\n  activities only an owner can; like being
      the head cheerleader, the visionary, the\n  strategist, the keeper of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We\n  call the CEO Emeritus Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets\n  Advanced Course covers
      The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the\n  Standard Bearer
      is the person that maintains the level of how well the organization\n  performs
      all work. Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are\n  in
      the building versus when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic at
      work.\n  It’s not that you are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present.\n  Your people know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the\n  standard is an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally\n  well, hundreds or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time.\n  The reason is that the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities\n  which only the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million\n  check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      do you need to do to tweak your business\n  model so your business is worth
      $20 million? Focus on number one and number two\n  of the &quot;A&quot; categories
      (excellent margins and easy to sell) of Business\n  Model Secrets. If you have
      excellent margins and a product that’s easy to sell,\n  you are well on your
      way to creating a powerful business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you\n  are serious
      about selling your business in the next two or three years, go to a\n  business
      broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money for a business assessment;\n
      \ it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what someone will pay for
      it.\n  The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people pay too much
      for businesses,\n  and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment
      says their business is\n  worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend
      spending five or ten thousand\n  dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business.
      However, it’s a good exercise\n  to go to a business broker and talk to someone
      who buys and sells businesses all\n  day. Let them tell you how saleable your
      business is. They may have some tips to\n  get your business more saleable and
      get a fair market assessment on the value of\n  your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we focus extensively
      on the techniques needed to become a CEO Emeritus.\n  Once you have achieved
      Emeritus status, you might not want to sell your business.\n  In our opinion,
      CEO Emeritus is the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge\n  with clients
      is getting them to believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week\n  and
      make more than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be
      used\n  for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror
      stories\n  about someone who bought a business and it went badly. Bad purchases
      done poorly\n  go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will discuss
      criteria for a\n  good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next
      level.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:51:20.449363000Z\nupdated_at: 2011-11-22

      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p>FIRST\n
      \ IMAGE</p>\\r\\n<p>The CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The
      CEO Emeritus\n  creates a business that runs very well without their direct
      daily input. The CEO\n  Emeritus works the hours that she wants to work, gets
      paid a terrific salary (what\n  you earn right now or maybe more), does work
      that she wants to do, and performs\n  activities only an owner can; like being
      the head cheerleader, the visionary, the\n  strategist, the keeper of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We\n  call the CEO Emeritus Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets\n  Advanced Course covers
      The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the\n  Standard Bearer
      is the person that maintains the level of how well the organization\n  performs
      all work. Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are\n  in
      the building versus when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic at
      work.\n  It’s not that you are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present.\n  Your people know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the\n  standard is an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally\n  well, hundreds or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time.\n  The reason is that the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities\n  which only the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million\n  check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      do you need to do to tweak your business\n  model so your business is worth
      $20 million? Focus on number one and number two\n  of the &quot;A&quot; categories
      (excellent margins and easy to sell) of Business\n  Model Secrets. If you have
      excellent margins and a product that’s easy to sell,\n  you are well on your
      way to creating a powerful business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you\n  are serious
      about selling your business in the next two or three years, visit a\n  business
      broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money for a business assessment;\n
      \ it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what someone will pay for
      it.\n  The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people pay too much
      for businesses,\n  and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment
      says their business is\n  worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend
      spending five or ten thousand\n  dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business.
      However, it’s a good exercise\n  to go to a business broker and talk to someone
      who buys and sells businesses all\n  day. Let them tell you how saleable your
      business is. They may have some tips to\n  get your business more saleable and
      get a fair market assessment on the value of\n  your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we focus extensively
      on the techniques needed to become a CEO Emeritus.\n  Once you have achieved
      Emeritus status, you might not want to sell your business.\n  In our opinion,
      CEO Emeritus is the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge\n  with clients
      is getting them to believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week\n  and
      make more than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be
      used\n  for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror
      stories\n  about someone who bought a business and it went badly. Bad purchases
      done poorly\n  go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will discuss
      criteria for a\n  good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next
      level.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:51:20.460630000Z\nupdated_at: 2011-11-22

      \ location. In a business to business environment, location isn’t necessarily

      tight radius of their\n  physical location. If you cannot find qualified personnel
      due to your location,\n  you could have a problem hiring and recruiting talented
      people.</p>\\r\\n<p>What happens\n  if the price of gasoline goes to $10 a gallon
      resulting in a huge shipping problem?\n  I was in a business where we had a
      very heavy product which limited us to a 500\n  mile shipping radius. Plus,
      it was a deposit-type product, so there were two-way\n  freight charges. If
      gas prices went to $10 a gallon, we would have to reduce the\n  shipping radius
      from 500 hundred miles to 250 miles and lose all the metropolitan\n  areas outside

      everything going for\n  it - other than a lawsuit filed every month for several
      million dollars. Even if\n  Taser wins most of these lawsuits, which they do,
      they still have an incredible\n  legal bill. Taser has to budget for this legal
      bill and it eats into their profits\n  substantially. It doesn’t matter if they
      win or lose; they are going to get sued\n  regularly. Does your business have
      a similar issue? Are you going to be prone to\n  lawsuits or unnecessary expenses

      Let’s\n  go back to Taser. If Taser could push through legislation which said
      Taser is a\n  valuable asset to law enforcement, and therefore any Taser used
      in law enforcement\n  is automatically immune from any lawsuit, how would that

      location. In a business to business environment, location\n  isn’t necessarily
      a handicap. However, most businesses pull their labor force from\n  within a
      tight radius of their physical location. If you cannot find qualified personnel\n
      \ due to your location, you could have a problem hiring and recruiting talented
      people.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  happens if the price of gasoline goes to $10 a gallon
      resulting in a huge shipping\n  problem? I was in a business where we had a
      very heavy product which limited us\n  to a 500 mile shipping radius. Plus,
      it was a deposit-type product, so there were\n  two-way freight charges. If
      gas prices went to $10 a gallon, we would have to reduce\n  the shipping radius
      from 500 hundred miles to 250 miles and lose all the metropolitan\n  areas outside
      of the 250 mile radius. Does your existing business plan accommodate\n  these
      types of issues?</p>\\r\\n<p>The Pitfall section contains a special component\n
      \ called the &quot;Taser Test.&quot; Taser has a terrific business model. Their
      stun\n  guns are a highly proprietary product. They invented the market for
      stun guns. It’s\n  a very high-margin product. It’s a beloved brand. Taser has
      everything going for\n  it - other than a lawsuit filed every month for several
      million dollars. Even if\n  Taser wins most of these lawsuits, which they do,
      they still have an incredible\n  legal bill. Taser has to budget for this legal
      bill and it eats into their profits\n  substantially. It doesn’t matter if they
      win or lose; they are going to get sued\n  regularly. Does your business have
      a similar issue? Are you going to be prone to\n  lawsuits or unnecessary expenses
      simply because of the business model that you are\n  operating?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Are there pitfalls in your business\n  model? Your
      first inclination is to say, &quot;No.&quot; This is the fair and accurate\n
      \ 90% of the time. Is there a way to mitigate or eliminate any and all pitfalls?
      Let’s\n  go back to Taser. If Taser could push through legislation which said
      Taser is a\n  valuable asset to law enforcement, and therefore any Taser used
      in law enforcement\n  is automatically immune from any lawsuit, how would that
      alter Taser’s business\n  model? Substantially, right? Is there a similar change
      you can make to your model?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Find yourself
      a sounding-board partner to do the following exercise.\n  It is known by you
      and your partner that it is possible to remove any pitfalls that\n  may exist
      in your business. How does this happen? Remember, it’s KNOWN to be possible.\n
      \ No, &quot;yeah but&quot; excuses! No, &quot;I can’t because.&quot; It IS possible\n
      \ to remove or greatly mitigate all pitfalls in your business. How does this
      come\n  about from where you are currently? What does this picture look like?
      Think long\n  and hard, use the sounding-board partner, and be nothing but positive.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n
      \ Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Mitigating pitfalls can be difficult. Many CEOs say,
      &quot;There\n  is nothing I can do about this.&quot; Here is a great example
      of a Business Model\n  Secrets program success story. This particular client
      used a tremendous amount of\n  extruded aluminum. As commodity prices fluctuated
      wildly, he was losing money on\n  some bids because his quote to the customer
      was a fixed price but his raw materials\n  cost went up or down unpredictably.
      As a solution to this issue, we convinced him\n  to purchase a futures contract
      on aluminum. If prices went up, he would lose money\n  on aluminum purchases,
      but he would make it back on the futures contract. If prices\n  went down, he
      would lose money on the futures contract but get cost savings. This\n  technique
      effectively removed the pitfall.</p>\\r\\n<p>There are also several quick\n
      \ and easy legal tricks to dramatically lower risk. One of them costs only $100.
      We\n  discuss these methods in the Business Model Secrets Advanced Course.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      is the proprietary methodology used to acquire, service, and retain\n  customers.&quot;
      &mdash; Jim Muehlhausen, Author &quot;The 51 Fatal Business Errors\n  and How
      to Avoid Them&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your business model is your secret sauce.\n
      \ Your model is what makes your business unique. Your business model is the
      formula\n  you use to outsmart your competitors, provide ongoing value to customers,
      and continually\n  grow your business. There are eight essential areas to a
      business model:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n  have excellent margins</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      be easy to sell</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must have\n  The Four Capitals&copy;: Intellectual
      Capital, Financial Capital, Human Capital\n  and Brand Capital</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      be able to maintain ongoing competitive advantage</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n  have
      quality customers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must have longevity of the industry</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n
      \ provide for the owner’s graceful exit</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must avoid pitfalls</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Not\n
      \ all the areas carry an equal weight. As you can see from the graph of the
      section\n  weighs below, the combination of excellent margins plus an easy to
      sell product\n  account for over one half of the total score. Significant research
      has gone into\n  this scoring process to assess your business model with the
      greatest accuracy. Remember\n  that your competitors are actively working to
      improve there competitive position\n  and therefore business models erode over
      time. No matter what your score, your best\n  source of competitive advantage
      is to be continually actively working to refine\n  and improve your business
      model.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1323378575149393.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"The Ideal Business Model\\\" title=\\\"The Ideal Business Model\\\"
      /></p>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the past, you may not have given much thought to your business
      model. Most business\n  books teach us that our business plan is the most important
      tool for managing our\n  business success. However, a stellar business plan
      is not much good without a solid\n  business model behind it.</p>\\r\\n<div
      style=\\\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\n  text-align: center;\\\">Great
      business plan + bad business model = a bad business</div>\\r\\n<div\n  style=\\\"font-weight:
      bold; font-style: italic; text-align: center;\\\">Average business\n  plan +
      great business model = a great business</div>\\r\\n<p>Previously, there were\n
      \ no objective criteria for gauging the quality of a business model. Venture
      capitalists\n  and bankers had been judging business models for years, but on
      subjective, gut impressions.\n  Our model uses a scientific, objective approach
      to grading an existing business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are still not sold
      on the importance of your business model,\n  ponder this: all business models
      will go stale if unaltered. Typically, this process\n  takes ten to twenty years.
      Here are some examples:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockbuster\n  video made
      hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in the 1990’s and commanded\n  a
      90% market share. Today it is nearly defunct.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IBM has successfully\n
      \ morphed its business model several times over the years in order to remain
      successful\n  vs. Xerox and Kodak who have not.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Radio stations
      were a profitable\n  cash cow for decades until iPods came along.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If
      you were Wal-Mart\n  in the 1990s, would you have figured that your biggest
      competitor would be Amazon.com?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>For\n  many retailers, the
      tried and true Yellow Pages method of customer attraction has\n  stopped working.
      Successful retailers have changed their client attraction model\n  to continue
      their success.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>This Business Model Evaluator Report\n
      \ below has several specific suggestions how to innovate biz model. Work with
      your\n  consulting partner to implement these solutions and watch your business
      grow.</p>\"\nid: 1\n"

      matter what business you are\n  in, there are times when borrowing money makes
      good financial sense. Trying to finance\n  growth internally presents challenges
      and restrictions to most companies especially\n  when upfront investment is
      required, and the proper capital structure and working\n  capital support are
      not in place.</p>\\r\\n<p>Even if you are not contemplating a\n  loan, bankers
      are merely very cautious investors who only invest in strong companies\n  that
      are well run. For this reason, the Bankability Index is actually a report card\n
      \ on the strength of [Company Name] and its ability to generate an attractive
      ROI.\n  For this reason, it is highly instructive for you as CEO to know how
      bankable [Company\n  Name] is and also things you might do to improve.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      first step for [Company\n  Name] to apply for a loan will be to present your
      bank with a comprehensive overview\n  of your business by providing them with
      a business plan that gives them a full strategic\n  understanding of you and
      [Company Name]. The business plan will need to address\n  any challenges that
      you and the company are facing and a plan of how you are meeting\n  them - now
      and in the next couple of years.</p>\\r\\n<p>It is useful to the bank,\n  if
      not required, to provide a detailed explanation of the purpose of the loan.
      This\n  could for example be an outline of how the purchase of additional equipment
      would\n  enhance revenues, efficiencies and profitably. You should include relevant
      information\n  such as purchasing contract details outlining delivered and installed
      price, capital\n  expenditure justification studies and projected timelines.
      An integral part of the\n  information will be a schedule detailing the projected
      cash-flow and draws against\n  the desired loan for [Company Name].</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      will be required to provide a\n  full set of financial reports, which will include
      at least the most recent balance\n  sheet and income statements for [Company
      Name] as well as any notes that would provide\n  them with a clear understanding
      of the company’s financial condition. Most banks\n  prefer at least 2 trading
      year’s worth of financials and will not even consider\n  any company that cannot
      provide this. A bank loan is highly unlikely if you have\n  not been in business
      for more than 2 years. This information will allow the bank\n  to gain a proper
      understanding of recent trends within your business. Personal financial\n  information
      is increasingly being used to supplement the company’s information.\n  So you
      will likely be required to provide your FICO score and full personal financial\n
      \ reports.</p>\\r\\n<p>A perennial problem with small businesses is the fact
      that owners\n  generally see it as an accepted benefit to run personal expenses
      through the business.\n  The owner’s salary is an acceptable business expense
      as long as they are active\n  in the running of the business, it is justifiable.
      Whatever the Taxman does or does\n  not allow beyond this is largely irrelevant
      to an investor except to the extent\n  that it might detract from the business.
      An investor is really only concerned with\n  the actual ability of the business
      to generate an acceptable return. Strictly speaking,\n  the strongest P&amp;L
      will be one that has been &amp;Normalized&amp; by taking out\n  all discretionary
      and extra-ordinary personal income benefits and expenses that\n  the owner draws
      or puts through the business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Banks all take different\n  approaches
      to establish lending criteria, which are commonly called &amp;Loan Covenants&amp;.\n
      \ Most of the criteria that are used rely on analysis of the borrowing company’s
      recent\n  financial statements to determine their financial strength and performance.
      If [Company\n  Name] is felt to present an acceptable risk to the bank, the
      loan is made. If not,\n  there is generally no explanation given. Lenders know
      they must take risks, but\n  they don’t want those risks made known so when
      a loan application is declined, the\n  applicant is left wondering what happened!
      You are no further forward and obviously\n  could still use a loan to move your
      business forward. This all begs the question\n  of: what [Company Name] would
      need to do to position the business to be an acceptable\n  risk and qualify
      for a loan.</p>\\r\\n<p>Factors taken into consideration by the banks\n  are:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Liquidity
      and stability</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Equity</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Debt\n  and Leverage</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Cash
      Flow and receivables</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Other investments</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Capital\n
      \ structure</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Distributions</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Various pieces of
      non-financial\n  data</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Banking conditions have changed
      significantly over the\n  last 10 years and banks are now subject to far more
      rigorous restrictions than previously\n  seen. Consequently loans are far harder
      to get and many banks are simply unable\n  or unwilling to lend at this time.
      Loan agreements contain covenants - conditions\n  that the borrower must meet
      in order to get a loan and stay financed. Lending criteria\n  have shifted as
      a consequence of changes in the borrowing patterns and covenants\n  are not
      only different but far more stringent than in years past.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n
      \ instance, reduced personal equity on the part of small business owners is
      endemic,\n  which makes the need for borrowing more critical than ever, but
      makes loans far\n  more difficult to get. Banks increasingly have to take account
      of non-financial\n  data to gain comfort that you and [Company Name] are an
      acceptable risk.</p>\\r\\n<p>CEO\n  Focus has constructed a program that utilizes
      proprietary algorithms to evaluate\n  both financial and non-financial information
      to calculate the company’s Bankability\n  Index&trade;. The program is continually
      calibrated against data drawn from businesses\n  across the USA and gives powerful
      insight into your chances of getting a loan and\n  what [Company Name] can do
      to improve their Bankability Index.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Lending\n  Criteria</h2>\\r\\n<p>In
      general, banks that take a more restrictive approach to lending\n  are more
      likely to set tighter covenants and be less forgiving of borrower deviations\n
      \ and violations. Banks that set covenants in conjunction with the borrower
      are more\n  flexible on their terms. Banks are increasingly looking at the business
      owner’s\n  FICO score and financial statements as a measure of how responsibly
      they conduct\n  their personal financial affairs. They want the borrower to
      be part of setting the\n  covenants, so that they will be less likely to deviate
      from or violate them. Smaller\n  banks generally fall into this category but
      some larger banks operate this way too,\n  which is why it is important to have
      a good relationship with your banker. Many\n  of the larger banks have been
      accused of moving loan officers and bank managers\n  regularly to prevent a
      strong relationship from being established.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  aim of covenants
      is to protect the bank from default on the part of the borrower\n  but also
      to provide clear and reasonable parameters and actions up front, which\n  govern
      default conditions and remedial actions. Most loan documents contain at least\n
      \ 2 conditions of default that could be extremely serious for the borrower.
      There\n  are 3 factors in play:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>To establish that
      [Company Name] has\n  the ability to repay the loan</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>To provide
      a means to appropriately\n  revisit that assumption during the life of the loan</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>To
      provide remedies\n  if the Bank feels at any stage that the loan is insecure
      as a result of changes\n  in [Company Name] or an adverse event affecting your
      financial condition.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>[Company\n  Name] needs to bear
      in mind that there are factors that may be outside of your control\n  but that
      could still negatively impact your loan:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Change in\n
      \ account officer: the bank may at any time replace the officer administering
      the\n  loan. Should there be a significant difference in approach, personality
      conflict\n  or any misunderstanding; the new officer may deem the bank’s position
      to be insecure.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Bank\n  Policy Changes: mergers, acquisitions
      or changes in banking regulations can lead\n  to changes in the loan conditions.
      [Company Name] has no assurances that the lending\n  bank will continue to provide
      credit to them or even any company in their industry.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Properly\n
      \ set covenants provide a clear framework of parameters to [Company Name] and
      a schedule\n  of review and adjustment (probably annually) that is designed
      to protect the lender\n  from borrower meltdown and provide them comfort that
      the loan is secure. [Company\n  Name] and your comfort comes from the knowledge
      that as long as you both abide by\n  the covenants and work with the bank, your
      loan will most likely continue to be\n  entertained by the bank.</p>\\r\\n<h2>The
      Anatomy of a Loan Agreement</h2>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the past small and medium sized
      companies rarely had the option or opportunity to\n  negotiate commercial loan
      agreements with the lender. The banks dictated the terms\n  and standard agreements
      were used, thereby eliminating the need for referral to\n  higher authority
      and cost to both the bank and the borrower of hiring counsel to\n  evaluate
      or negotiate the terms. In most instances loans were paid off without ever\n
      \ having to refer to the fine print.</p>\\r\\n<p>However while still unusual,
      it is\n  becoming more prevalent that borrowers are putting their banks standard
      loan conditions\n  through close scrutiny to identify terms that would be detrimental
      or and undue\n  burden to [Company Name]. You will generally not be allowed
      to negotiate the terms\n  of their standard agreement, but it never hurts to
      ask. In the event that this is\n  allowed and you find something worth fighting
      for (like an unduly onerous penalty\n  interest rate), there is a down side
      that you need to be aware of. The bank would\n  need to retain counsel to cover
      their position and to negotiate any changes to the\n  standard loan terms and
      conditions. In general these costs would be passed directly\n  on to [Company
      Name], and they will not come cheap! So while due diligence is vital,\n  it
      is important to keep any negotiations to a minimum while ensuring that [Company\n
      \ Name] has the best deal possible.</p>\\r\\n<p>Regardless of whether the bank
      or [Company\n  Name] retains counsel or not, you should make sure that the following
      aspects are\n  well taken care of:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t3.1
      Scope. Most loan agreements\n  contains the following sections:\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.1
      Statement of the\n  loan terms,</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.2 Warranties and
      representations about [Company\n  Name], its properties and its operations,</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.3
      Covenants which\n  may be affirmative (things [Company Name] is required to
      comply with), negative\n  (things you may not do) and financial (financial performance
      criteria which will\n  be monitored by the bank to determine continued financial
      wellbeing), and</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.4\n  Events of default.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t3.2
      Loan Terms.\n  The loan terms that should be reviewed are:\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.1
      Stated\n  Rate of Interest. Is this reasonable in terms of the financial condition
      and strength\n  of [Company Name]?</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.2 Default Rate
      of Interest. Is the default\n  rate reasonable? (2% over the stated rate is
      the norm)? Under what conditions is\n  the default rate levied? Payment default
      or any default? Will [Company Name] be\n  notified or will it automatically
      become activated while the default persists? And\n  is it in addition to, or
      in lieu of, late payment charges (which may be subject\n  to specific conditions
      and limitations depending of applicable State Laws).</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.3\n
      \ Due Dates of Payments. Is the interest on the loan pre-computed? If not, will
      [Company\n  Name] get an interest statement from the lender in time to make
      the monthly payment\n  of interest?</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.4 Prepayments.
      Do the loan documents permit prepayments\n  without penalty?</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.5
      Attorney's Fees. [Company Name] will generally\n  be required to pay the bank's
      collection costs, including its attorneys' fees and\n  expenses. Many lenders
      standard terms levy fees based on a percentage of the outstanding\n  loan amount.
      This can often far exceed the reasonable cost based on hourly rates.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.3\n
      \ Warranties and Representations. These are conditions binding [Company Name].
      Most\n  relate to the legal status of [Company Name] and its ability to enter
      into the loan\n  transaction. Others relate to enforceability of the loan conditions
      to [Company\n  Name]. All of these should be reviewed to determine if they are
      relevant to the\n  bank's underwriting of the loan. Violation of warranty or
      representation conditions\n  are generally grounds for the lender to invoke
      default remedies under the loan conditions,\n  which include the suspension
      of any pending advances or facilities.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.4\n  Covenants. The
      type and nature of the required covenants will most likely depend\n  on the
      size and policies of the bank, and the size, duration and type of loan. The\n
      \ covenants should be reviewed to make sure that [Company Name] current and
      anticipated\n  operations are likely to meet the covenants. Financial and information
      reporting\n  requirements should be reviewed with management, financial and
      accounting officers\n  to make sure that the company is capable of reasonably
      producing the reports and\n  required information in a timely manner. It should
      be ensured that any financial\n  covenants or reporting are in line with your
      accounting practices.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.5\n  Defaults. The list of defaults
      warrants close scrutiny and is worth spending considerable\n  time on. The list
      of defaults provides the bank with the conditions under which\n  it may terminate
      its lending relationship with [Company Name] and demand immediate\n  repayment
      of the loan. Care should be taken to understand these conditions and to\n  ensure
      that unintentional conditions will not trigger a reaction form the lender\n
      \ without the opportunity of redress within a reasonable grace period. Generally
      these\n  relate to missed payment deadlines and banks are more open to working
      with borrowers\n  now than they might have previously been, but may put a limit
      on the number of late\n  notices they will tolerate before taking action.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.6
      Maintaining a\n  Good Relationship. Any decisions relating to considerations,
      consents or waivers\n  of covenant defaults will depend heavily on [Company
      Name] relationship with the\n  lender. That relationship is built at the time
      of granting the loan so can materially\n  affect the loan rates. Since this
      relationship continues over the life of the loan\n  through the review process,
      a good relationship between you and your banker is critical\n  since your banker
      is your most powerful and worthwhile ally.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Covenent\n
      \ Categories Commonly Used by Bands</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company Name] Balance Sheet
      and Income\n  Statements will give you most of what will be needed to determine
      a complete financial\n  picture of [Company Name]. Now often business owners
      run different sets of books\n  &ndash; one for the IRS, one for the banker and
      one for the owner to know what is\n  actually going on. The difficulty comes
      in that you cannot fool all of the people\n  all of the time and the worst possible
      person to kid, is yourself! This is closely\n  followed by your banker since
      if you are going to have an extended relationship\n  with your banker they will
      probably pick up on inconsistent details and start to\n  ask pointed questions
      about [Company Name], quite probably at the time that you\n  would least like
      them to be doing so.</p>\\r\\n<p>Financial ratios are commonly used\n  to measure
      businesses against common criteria. Ratios would look at specific aspects\n
      \ of [Company Name] in relationship to others to gain an understanding and measure\n
      \ of [Company Name]'s strength or weakness in specific areas. Ratios can be
      used to\n  quickly and simply compare companies of different size and industries
      by:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Tracking\n  ratios for [Company Name] across a
      number of trading periods,</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Comparing\n  [Company Name]'s ratios
      to those of other companies or industry norms</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Showing\n  if
      projected scenarios and business plans are likely to be successful.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ are some of the ratios and parameters that banks might use to measure [Company
      Name]\n  performance in evaluating your loan application as well as to track
      it after the\n  loan has been granted.</p>\\r\\n<p>Each lender will have their
      own preferences but\n  many parameters are less impactful on the overall score
      and only really come into\n  play in marginal cases or when the finer details
      of a loan are being discussed with\n  your banker. However it is useful to know
      the commonly used characteristics and\n  their associated ratios that your bank
      might consider in evaluating your loan application.\n  These are listed in this
      section.</p>\\r\\n<p>CEO Focus has worked with a range of\n  lenders across
      the country to distill the essence of these ratios in order to provide\n  a
      simpler yet adequately accurate indication of [Company Name]’s probability of\n
      \ getting the desired loan based on the information provided.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t4.1\n

      \ Equity &ndash; Usually covenants require a minimum level of equity in [Company
      Name].\n  Felt by bankers to be important in the meltdown environment &ndash;
      however hard\n  to quantify since small business owners generally no longer
      have the kind of equity\n  that they once did and are relying on loans to fund/carry
      their business.\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>4.2.1\n  Tangible Net Worth

      Thresholds, break points, coefficients\n  and weighting values are based in
      theory and best practices, however because of\n  the difficulty associated providing
      a comprehensive theoretical basis, modifiers\n  are applied on an empirical

      to\n  the relationship between the drivers within the equation may give more
      specific\n  context to the commentary. This lies outside of the scope of this
      exercise, however\n  your facilitator would be glad to discuss options to go

      ! \"<h4>You scored &quot;low&quot; on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary\n
      \ determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill
      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, we would actually be able
      to accomplish our sales\n  objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars is never
      the problem and the quality\n  of the sales staff is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the\n  salability of the product combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent.\n  Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on building\n  a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"
      alt=\\\"Selling Ice to Eskimos?\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey - Area
      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You can do a better job ignoring\n  your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants, needs and\n  desires.&quot;
      Instead, listen to the market. You should pay attention to market\n  data, not
      your own subjective opinions. Listening to the market instead of listening\n
      \ to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product needs to be sold. However, some products need more selling and others
      need\n  more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance,
      insurance\n  tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  easiest way to determine whether your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to\n  do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling marketing at all. It all\n  goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you have the best sales force\n  in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What happens to your sales?\n  Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over\n  the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people selling. However,\n
      \ the best marketing team in the world works with your product. You get all
      those\n  promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,
      Web 2.0 strategies,\n  every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented. What happens?\n  Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects\n  to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business owners\n  who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really\n
      \ the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make
      the\n  product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is filling\n  an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is\n  closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC\n  contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times\n  we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black\n  magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem
      to do it. Perhaps we give\n  them more credit than they deserve. Great sales
      people who move from company to\n  company and continue to sell well do so because
      they are great at understanding\n  how to sell products. This does not mean
      they excel at feature/benefit presentations.\n  The secret of great sales people
      is they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  of the truly
      great sales people do it naturally, without knowing how they do it.\n  They
      create a procedure, a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless,\n
      \ which result in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every
      company,\n  if you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create
      a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this,
      you probably have a\n  definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable\n  and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined?\n  If you don’t know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have\n  an easy time selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are\n  you trying to search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this,\n  you probably know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old\n  saying in business, &quot;Find
      a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses\n  that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;
      product are in front of the parade, not behind\n  it. Most products and services
      only have a 20-year life span. You want to be out\n  in front of the growth
      curve, not chasing it. Nothing is worse than being a late\n  entry into a market
      which is maturing. When this happens, prices drop, competition\n  increases,
      and the market declines. These are the markets you not only want to avoid\n
      \ getting into, but want to get out of. You always need to be aware of where
      you are\n  in the product development and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img
      src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074471966546.jpg\\\"\n  alt=\\\"Business
      Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ you analyzing true, unfiltered data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting\n
      \ data to be what you want or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming
      your sales\n  people for marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you created
      a definable and repeatable\n  sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you in front
      of the parade or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If\n  you are behind the parade,
      how can you alter the customers you sell to, and the\n  product or service mix
      you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n  your
      parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade\n
      \ to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you looked at your existing prospect
      list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how you find, generate
      interest\n  from, and sell prospects? Have you gone through your prospect list
      to see if you\n  can create a process for finding more of them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal ball three, four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future of your company holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the\n  general environment your company
      will be operating in. What does this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state
      economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell\n  to look like?
      Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology\n  trends
      exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your predictions of the\n
      \ future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front
      of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business
      Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How
      did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate interest from them
      during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when
      analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe what you want to
      believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit
      down with your best salespeople and/or your best former\n  salespeople and pick
      their brains. Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll\n  be inclined
      to tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold\n  stuff.&quot;
      This is not true. They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail,\n  the
      last five big sales they had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and\n
      \ search for the commonalities. There will be plenty of them. Now take that
      information\n  and create a company-wide, repeatable sales process so you can
      elevate the performance\n  of your average, and not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved\n  or underserved markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get\n  ahead of the competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will\n  be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n  business owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from\n  Thomas Edison and King Gillette

      Instead, you are listening to the market.\n  Great job! You need to pay attention
      to market data, not your own subjective opinions.\n  Listening to the market
      instead of listening to yourself is a great tactic to use\n  to create an easy-to-sell
      product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to be sold. However,\n  some products
      need more selling and others need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n
      \ the sale. For instance, insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n
      \ tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine
      whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I
      call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example: if you could only sell
      your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would happen? This means
      no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling marketing at all.
      It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However, you have the best
      sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars. What happens
      to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now
      flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n  not even bad-sales-people
      selling. However, the best marketing team in the world\n  works with your product.
      You get all those promotional items that you currently\n  don’t have: marketing
      geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique\n  you can
      think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ truth, marketing brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to\n  you they are sometimes fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses,\n  marketing partially sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this question can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more\n  important for your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times\n  I see business owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite\n  to the sale is really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective\n  in order to
      make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy\n  to
      sell is filling an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing\n
      \ the demand for the product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself: How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your customers would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n  your answer is closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding\n  another HVAC contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product or service should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process.
      Many times we see an outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and
      perform their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just
      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does
      not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great
      sales people is\n  they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally, without knowing how they
      do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones,
      but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable and repeatable sales process.
      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is
      to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales process. Since you
      scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n  repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n  sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined? If you don’t\n  know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have an easy time\n  selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are you trying to\n  search for a needle
      in a haystack? Since you scored well on this, you probably know\n  the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old saying in business,\n  &quot;Find
      a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n
      \ product are in front of the parade, not behind it. Most products and services
      only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be out in front of the growth
      curve, not chasing\n  it. Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market
      which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop, competition increases,
      and the market declines. These\n  are the markets you not only want to avoid
      getting into, but want to get out of.\n  You always need to be aware of where
      you are in the product development and product\n  life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n  your
      parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade\n

      to see if you\n  can create a process for finding more of them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal ball three, four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future of your company holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the\n  general environment your company
      will be operating in. What does this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state
      economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell\n  to look like?
      Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology\n  trends
      exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your predictions of the\n
      \ future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front
      of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business
      Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How
      did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate interest from them
      during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when
      analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe what you want to
      believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit
      down with your best salespeople and/or your best former\n  salespeople and pick
      their brains. Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll\n  be inclined
      to tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold\n  stuff.&quot;
      This is not true. They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail,\n  the
      last five big sales they had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and\n
      \ search for the commonalities. There will be plenty of them. Now take that
      information\n  and create a company-wide, repeatable sales process so you can
      elevate the performance\n  of your average, and not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved\n  or underserved markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get\n  ahead of the competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will\n  be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n  business owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There

      ! \"<h4>You scored well on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary determinant\n
      \ of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill can sell
      a reasonable\n  amount of the product or service. The salesperson should not
      have to sell ice to\n  Eskimos. Many times business owners think, &quot;If we
      could just get some sales\n  superstars in here, we would actually be able to
      accomplish our sales objectives.&quot;\n  A lack of sales superstars is never
      the problem and the quality of the sales staff\n  is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the salability of the product\n  combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent. Since you have a highly sellable\n  product,
      you can focus your attention on building a strong sales and marketing process\n
      \ to amplify the product’s salability.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"\n

      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You\n  are doing a pretty good job ignoring your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what\n  the customer wants, needs and desires.&quot;
      Instead, you are listening to the market.\n  Great job! You need to pay attention
      to market data, not your own subjective opinions.\n  Listening to the market
      instead of listening to yourself is a great tactic to use\n  to create an easy-to-sell
      product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to be sold. However,\n  some products
      need more selling and others need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n
      \ the sale. For instance, insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n
      \ tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine
      whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I
      call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example: if you could only sell
      your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would happen? This means
      no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling marketing at all.
      It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However, you have the best
      sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars. What happens
      to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now
      flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n  not even bad-sales-people
      selling. However, the best marketing team in the world\n  works with your product.
      You get all those promotional items that you currently\n  don’t have: marketing
      geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique\n  you can
      think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ truth, marketing brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to\n  you they are sometimes fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses,\n  marketing partially sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this question can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more\n  important for your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times\n  I see business owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite\n  to the sale is really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective\n  in order to
      make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy\n  to
      sell is filling an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing\n
      \ the demand for the product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself: How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your customers would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n  your answer is closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding\n  another HVAC contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product or service should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process.
      Many times we see an outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and
      perform their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just
      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does
      not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great
      sales people is\n  they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally, without knowing how they
      do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones,
      but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable and repeatable sales process.
      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is
      to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales process. Since you
      scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n  repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n  sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined? If you don’t\n  know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have an easy time\n  selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are you trying to\n  search for a needle
      in a haystack? Since you scored well on this, you probably know\n  the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old saying in business,\n  &quot;Find
      a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n
      \ product are in front of the parade, not behind it. Most products and services
      only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be out in front of the growth
      curve, not chasing\n  it. Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market
      which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop, competition increases,
      and the market declines. These\n  are the markets you not only want to avoid
      getting into, but want to get out of.\n  You always need to be aware of where
      you are in the product development and product\n  life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ you analyzing true, unfiltered data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting\n
      \ data to be what you want or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming
      your sales\n  people for marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you created
      a definable and repeatable\n  sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you in front
      of the parade or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If\n  you are behind the parade,
      how can you alter the customers you sell to, and the\n  product or service mix
      you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n  your
      parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade\n
      \ to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you looked at your existing prospect
      list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how you find, generate
      interest\n  from, and sell prospects? Have you gone through your prospect list
      to see if you\n  can create a process for finding more of them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal ball three, four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future of your company holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the\n  general environment your company
      will be operating in. What does this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state
      economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell\n  to look like?
      Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology\n  trends
      exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your predictions of the\n
      \ future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front
      of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business
      Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How
      did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate interest from them
      during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when
      analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe what you want to
      believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      \ &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot; This
      is not\n  true. They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last
      five big sales\n  they had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and search
      for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that information
      and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable sales process so you can elevate the
      performance of your average, and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n

      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n
      \ get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his
      safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted
      by the marketplace,\n  but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer apathy, he created\n  a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole unit with handle\n  and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw the value and came\n  back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,
      a powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce
      reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      ! \"<h4>You scored below average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>In order to create\n
      \ an outstanding business model, you must improve your competitive advantage.
      You\n  must also be able to sustain this advantage over the long-term to have
      a stellar\n  business model. Look at AOL, all airlines other than Southwest,
      and Webvan (a former\n  $900MM grocery delivery company) as examples of a good
      model gone awry.</p>\\r\\n<p>You\n  have some work to do creating additional
      competitive landscape. Consider the finer\n  points below to improve your ongoing
      competitive advantage.</p>\\r\\n<p>An excellent\n  model for creating ongoing
      competitive advantage contains:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Customer\n
      \ Exit Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The Hotel California.</em>
      Like\n  the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you like, but you can
      never leave.&quot;\n  Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective at making
      it contractually or emotionally\n  difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning
      the standard.</em> Microsoft owns\n  many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office, you may be hurting yourself\n  more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able to share a standardized format\n  document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors. You may not like MS Office,\n  but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it. Many industrial companies besides\n  Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the standard. If you can accomplish this,\n
      \ it is difficult or impossible for your customers to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n\n
      \ \\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching cost.</em> Once you have spent a million dollars
      implementing\n  SAP software, you are less likely to switch to a different software
      company because\n  of the cost and headache involved. Find ways to build switching
      cost into your product\n  or service. Switching cost can take the form of dollar
      cost, emotional cost, organizational\n  inertia, or risk, individually or in
      any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low\n  value gained by switching.</em>
      Remember when you could switch long distance companies\n  and cut your bill
      in half? It was a bit of a hassle to switch, but the savings were\n  huge. These
      days, you save virtually nothing by switching long-distance carriers.\n  That’s
      why telemarketers are no longer calling to get you to switch long distance\n
      \ companies. It simply doesn’t result in enough savings for you to go to the
      bother.\n  Keep your pricing and value bundle close to that of your competition
      so the switching\n  cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>
      Nothing says, &quot;You can't\n  quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations can be difficult and sometimes\n  a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want to sell your business someday,\n  get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more accurately determined with\n  a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts with the best vendor\n  terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want
      to stock it, there goes 35% of\n  the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Continuous
      R&amp;D needed. Your R&amp;D spending may\n  serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to
      protect you from competitors. If ongoing R&D spending\n  is needed, an under-funded
      competitor will not be able to continue spending after\n  their initial entry
      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex
      or contacts. Your lifelong relationships with people that know, like, and\n
      \ trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Access to capital.
      Sometimes\n  the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>First\n
      \ mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the\n  market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Crest\n
      \ - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty
      synthetic\n  detergent</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery
      service</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>FedEx\n  - 1st overnight package delivery
      service.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n
      \ ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor
      entry\n  barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape.
      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>How would you rate your current competitive advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>Will\n
      \ you be able to sustain your competitive advantage? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>What is
      the single\n  most important action you can take to improve your competitive
      advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage?
      Can it be mitigated? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you create customer exit barriers?
      How long would this increase average retention?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  can you
      do to erect a &quot;moat&quot; around your business by creating competitor\n
      \ entry barriers?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Write down the names
      of your\n  five best customers. Assume a competitor is aggressively targeting
      those five customers.\n  The competitor will do everything in their power to
      steal those customers from you.\n  What will you do to stop this from happening?
      Pick the top two action items that\n  will aid in retaining each customer and
      do them! If any of these action items are\n  organizational improvements, implement
      them organization-wide.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently\n  enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer.\n  Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone\n
      \ assign someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of
      your competitors\n  if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      powerful\n  technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo
      Hunt&quot; to\n  a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where
      we look long and\n  hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start
      all over again. Not only\n  is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a
      business this way. There are proven\n  methods to move away from the Buffalo
      Hunt and toward a recurring revenue model.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:30:15.833709000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored well on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>It is not enough to create\n
      \ a current competitive advantage. You must be able to sustain this advantage
      over\n  the long term to have a stellar business model. Look at AOL, all airlines
      other\n  than Southwest, and Webvan (a former $900MM grocery delivery company)
      as examples\n  of good models gone awry.</p>\\r\\n<p>You have created a model
      with some insulation\n  from the changing competitive landscape. Consider the
      finer points below to reassess\n  your ongoing competitive advantage.</p>\\r\\n<p>An
      excellent model for creating ongoing\n  competitive advantage contains:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Customer
      Exit Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The\n  Hotel California.</em>
      Like the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you like,\n  but you can
      never leave.&quot; Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective at\n  making
      it contractually or emotionally difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning\n
      \ the standard.</em> Microsoft owns many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office,\n  you may be hurting yourself more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able\n  to share a standardized format document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors.\n  You may not like MS Office, but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it.\n  Many industrial companies besides Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the\n  standard. If you can accomplish this,
      it is difficult or impossible for your customers\n  to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching
      cost.</em> Once you have\n  spent a million dollars implementing SAP software,
      you are less likely to switch\n  to a different software company because of
      the cost and headache involved. Find\n  ways to build switching cost into your
      product or service. Switching cost can take\n  the form of dollar cost, emotional
      cost, organizational inertia, or risk, individually\n  or in any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low
      value gained by switching.</em>\n  Remember when you could switch long distance
      companies and cut your bill in half?\n  It was a bit of a hassle to switch,
      but the savings were huge. These days, you save\n  virtually nothing by switching
      long-distance carriers. That’s why telemarketers\n  are no longer calling to
      get you to switch long distance companies. It simply doesn’t\n  result in enough
      savings for you to go to the bother. Keep your pricing and value\n  bundle close
      to that of your competition so the switching cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>\n
      \ Nothing says, &quot;You can't quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations\n  can be difficult and sometimes a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want\n  to sell your business someday, get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more\n  accurately determined with a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts\n  with the best vendor terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want
      to stock it, there goes 35% of\n  the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Continuous
      R&amp;D needed. Your R&amp;D spending may\n  serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to
      protect you from competitors. If ongoing R&D spending\n  is needed, an under-funded
      competitor will not be able to continue spending after\n  their initial entry
      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex
      or contacts. Your lifelong relationships with people that know, like, and\n
      \ trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Access to capital.
      Sometimes\n  the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>First\n
      \ mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the\n  market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Crest\n
      \ - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty
      synthetic\n  detergent</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery
      service</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>FedEx\n  - 1st overnight package delivery
      service.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n
      \ ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor
      entry\n  barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape.
      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Will you be able to sustain your competitive advantage?
      How?</p>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  it possible to improve your competitive advantage? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      is the single\n  most important action you can take to improve your competitive
      advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage?

      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In
      order\n  to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you have\n  too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or if your\n  customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have quality\n  customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      our customers overly price conscious?\n  If customers have their eye on nothing
      but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses\n  to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers who\n  are going to
      attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that cannot\n  be accomplished,
      you are selling a product which the customer perceives as somewhat\n  generic.
      You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding can allow you\n  to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a premium for some\n
      \ attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does not need to
      be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences. For example, all
      the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and
      a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In
      every business\n  relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can
      &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money,
      so they dictate many of the business\n  terms. However, you need to be able
      to dictate many dynamics in the business relationship.\n  If not, you have a
      problem. For many companies, these seemingly insignificant terms\n  add up to
      a large portion of their profits. For instance, many companies have used\n  the
      self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own\n
      \ customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are dictating terms and dramatically\n
      \ lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer,
      so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A small vendor dealing
      with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms in the same way
      as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard some business
      stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen not do business with
      companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers\n  because all the terms are
      dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n  isn’t always
      a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently provides\n  many
      dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large customers, sometimes\n
      \ they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The third consideration
      of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract them compared to their
      lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue or margin.
      Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say that the
      cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average customer stays
      only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product at a 50 % margin
      during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n  vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve\n  this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring\n
      \ the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy places to find customers?\n
      \ Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak brand through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your\n  price or putting extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      \ Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Rank
      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have. Do they demand excessive\n  discounts even though they pay
      net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated\n  with carrying their accounts
      receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time\n  or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis\n  is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they\n  thought was their
      fourth best is actually their best customer and the one they thought\n  was
      their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult\n
      \ decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some
      customers\n  tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more
      money by not selling\n  to them. This is always a difficult realization because
      most business owners are\n  programmed to think that there is no such thing
      as a bad customer, and that anyone\n  who gives you money is a good customer.
      This is usually true. But occasionally,\n  it can be false. I encourage you
      to do a customer analysis annually to see what\n  the true margin provided by
      each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price\n  consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never\n  about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to\n  pay a
      certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features\n
      \ and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s
      add\n  value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly
      while providing\n  better value to the customer. This extra value may be in
      the form of a new or modified\n  product. For instance, make a premium version
      of your product. Figure out how to\n  add features, benefits, and attributes
      and see if that product will command a higher\n  price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate\n  ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years\n  ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market.\n
      \ These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice
      cream\n  became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never
      know what is\n  going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who
      would have figured\n  that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market
      when you can get a similar\n  cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\\r\\n\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      order\n  to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you have\n  too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or if your\n  customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have quality\n  customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even
      though you have quality customers,\n  are they still price conscious? If customers
      have their eye on nothing but price,\n  it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to remain profitable. Ideally, what needs\n  to be done is to find the customers
      who are going to attribute value to something,\n  other than sales price. If
      that cannot be accomplished, you are selling a product\n  which the customer
      perceives as somewhat generic. You need to work on your brand\n  to overcome
      this. Branding can allow you to attack a different segment of the marketplace,\n
      \ and charge a premium for some attribute other than the generic product. This
      attribute\n  does not need to be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences.
      For example,\n  all the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You
      squeeze a tube and\n  a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands
      exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In\n  every business relationship,
      one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate\n  terms.&quot; Can
      you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate\n  many of the
      business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics\n  in
      the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies, these\n
      \ seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance,\n  many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web
      to &quot;force&quot;\n  customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating\n  terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this
      is a minor &quot;term&quot;\n  to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor\n  dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same\n  way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business\n  stories about vendors that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies\n  like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers\n  are not quality customers because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A\n  quality customer
      isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently\n
      \ provides many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers,\n  sometimes they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration\n  of quality customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime\n  value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are\n  in a business with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a\n  new customer is $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell,\n  on average, $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend\n  half the lifetime value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario,\n  the cost of attraction
      vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer\n  is horrible. To
      improve this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower\n  the cost
      of acquiring the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There\n
      \ are several questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy places to find customers?\n
      \ Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak brand through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your\n  price or putting extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      Probably several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n

      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books who were purposely forfeited by\n  your

      receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time\n  or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis\n  is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they\n  thought was their
      fourth best is actually their best customer and the one they thought\n  was
      their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult\n
      \ decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some
      customers\n  tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more
      money by not selling\n  to them. This is always a difficult realization because
      most business owners are\n  programmed to think that there is no such thing
      as a bad customer, and that anyone\n  who gives you money is a good customer.
      This is usually true. But occasionally,\n  it can be false. I encourage you
      to do a customer analysis annually to see what\n  the true margin provided by
      each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price\n  consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never\n  about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to\n  pay a
      certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features\n
      \ and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s
      add\n  value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly
      while providing\n  better value to the customer. This extra value may be in
      the form of a new or modified\n  product. For instance, make a premium version
      of your product. Figure out how to\n  add features, benefits, and attributes
      and see if that product will command a higher\n  price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate\n  ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years\n  ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market.\n
      \ These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice
      cream\n  became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never
      know what is\n  going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who
      would have figured\n  that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market
      when you can get a similar\n  cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:34:15.723682000Z\nupdated_at: 2011-12-09

      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, we would actually be able

      the problem and the quality\n  of the sales staff is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the\n  salability of the product combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent.\n  Since you have a highly sellable

      process to amplify the product’s salability</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"

      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You can do a better job ignoring\n  your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants, needs and\n  desires.&quot;
      Instead, listen to the market. You should pay attention to market\n  data, not
      your own subjective opinions. Listening to the market instead of listening\n
      \ to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product needs to be sold. However, some products need more selling and others
      need\n  more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance,
      insurance\n  tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  easiest way to determine whether your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to\n  do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling marketing at all. It all\n  goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you have the best sales force\n  in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What happens to your sales?\n  Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over\n  the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people selling. However,\n
      \ the best marketing team in the world works with your product. You get all
      those\n  promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,
      Web 2.0 strategies,\n  every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented. What happens?\n  Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects\n  to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business owners\n  who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really\n
      \ the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make
      the\n  product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is filling\n  an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is\n  closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC\n  contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times\n  we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black\n  magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem
      to do it. Perhaps we give\n  them more credit than they deserve. Great sales
      people who move from company to\n  company and continue to sell well do so because
      they are great at understanding\n  how to sell products. This does not mean
      they excel at feature/benefit presentations.\n  The secret of great sales people
      is they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  of the truly
      great sales people do it naturally, without knowing how they do it.\n  They
      create a procedure, a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless,\n
      \ which result in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every
      company,\n  if you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create
      a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this,
      you probably have a\n  definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable\n  and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined?\n  If you don’t know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have\n  an easy time selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are\n  you trying to search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this,\n  you probably know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old\n  saying in business, &quot;Find
      a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses\n  that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;
      product are in front of the parade, not behind\n  it. Most products and services
      only have a 20-year life span. You want to be out\n  in front of the growth
      curve, not chasing it. Nothing is worse than being a late\n  entry into a market
      which is maturing. When this happens, prices drop, competition\n  increases,
      and the market declines. These are the markets you not only want to avoid\n
      \ getting into, but want to get out of. You always need to be aware of where
      you are\n  in the product development and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      how can you alter the customers you sell to, and the\n  product or service mix
      you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n  your
      parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade\n
      \ to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you looked at your existing prospect
      list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how you find, generate
      interest\n  from, and sell prospects? Have you gone through your prospect list
      to see if you\n  can create a process for finding more of them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal ball three, four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future of your company holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the\n  general environment your company
      will be operating in. What does this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state
      economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell\n  to look like?
      Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology\n  trends
      exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your predictions of the\n
      \ future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front
      of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business
      Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How
      did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate interest from them
      during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when
      analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe what you want to
      believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      style=\\\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 300px;\\\" />Sit\n  down with
      your best salespeople and/or your best former salespeople and pick their\n  brains.
      Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to tell you,\n
      \ &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot; This
      is not\n  true. They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last
      five big sales\n  they had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and search
      for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that information
      and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable sales process so you can elevate the
      performance of your average, and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n
      \ get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his
      safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted
      by the marketplace,\n  but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer apathy, he created\n  a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole unit with handle\n  and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw the value and came\n  back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,
      a powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce
      reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      a detailed, in-depth analysis like\n  this in the Business Model Secrets course.
      Take a look at your best ten or twenty\n  customers. How did you generate them
      as prospects? How did you generate interest\n  from them during initial conversations?
      How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic\n  when analyzing this. Don’t drink
      your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want to\n  believe. Think exclusively
      from the customer’s point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down\n  with your best salespeople
      and/or your best former salespeople and pick their brains.\n  Get insight into
      the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to tell you, &quot;I\n  don’t know
      how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot; This is not true.\n  They
      used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last five big sales they\n
      \ had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and search for the commonalities.\n
      \ There will be plenty of them. Now take that information and create a company-wide,\n

      Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine
      such superior products were not accepted by the marketplace,\n  but it happens
      all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat consumer apathy, he created\n  a
      massive network of partners to give away his razors (the whole unit with handle\n
      \ and blades) for free. Once consumers used the product, they saw the value
      and came\n  back for the high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy
      today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like Jell-O and Ford have used similar
      models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted as saying, &quot;I will give you the
      car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a
      powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce reliance

      ! \"<h4>You scored &quot;excellent&quot; on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary\n
      \ determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill
      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, then we would actually be
      able to accomplish\n  our sales objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars
      is never the problem and\n  the quality of the sales staff is almost never the
      sales issue. Typically, the issue\n  is the salability of the product combined
      with a potential shortcoming of sales\n  talent. Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on\n  building a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"
      alt=\\\"Selling Ice to Eskimos?\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey - Area
      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are doing a good job\n  ignoring your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants, needs\n  and desires.&quot;
      Instead, you are listening to the market. Great job! You need\n  to pay attention
      to market data, not your own subjective opinions. Listening to\n  the market
      instead of listening to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy\n  to
      sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to be sold. However, some products\n
      \ need more selling and others need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n
      \ the sale. For instance, insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n
      \ tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine
      whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I
      call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example: if you could only sell
      your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would happen? This means
      no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling marketing at all.
      It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However, you have the best
      sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars. What happens
      to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now
      flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n  not even bad-sales-people
      selling. However, the best marketing team in the world\n  works with your product.
      You get all those promotional items that you currently\n  don’t have: marketing
      geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique\n  you can
      think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ truth, marketing brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to\n  you they are sometimes fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses,\n  marketing partially sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this question can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more\n  important for your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times\n  I see business owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite\n  to the sale is really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective\n  in order to
      make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy\n  to
      sell is filling an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing\n
      \ the demand for the product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself: How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your customers would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n  your answer is closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding\n  another HVAC contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product or service should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process.
      Many times we see an outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and
      perform their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just
      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does
      not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great
      sales people is\n  they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally, without knowing how they
      do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones,
      but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable and repeatable sales process.
      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is
      to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales process. Since you
      scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n  repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n  sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined? If you don’t\n  know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have an easy time\n  selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are you trying to\n  search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this, you probably\n  know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old saying in business,\n  &quot;Find
      a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n
      \ product are in front of the parade, not behind it. Most products and services
      only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be out in front of the growth
      curve, not chasing\n  it. Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market
      which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop, competition increases,
      and the market declines. These\n  are the markets you not only want to avoid
      getting into, but want to get out of.\n  You always need to be aware of where
      you are in the product development and product\n  life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      ! \"<h4>You scored low on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates\n  is quoted as
      saying, &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant\n
      \ company.&quot; A great business cannot run without great people and your business\n
      \ has been successful attracting and retaining top talent. You may have struggled\n
      \ competing with big businesses regarding this. Have you figured out a strategy
      to\n  work without &quot;superstars&quot; yet still have a well-running business?
      This\n  is a &quot;must for many small businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep in mind
      that there is\n  an asset, not list on your balance sheet, called human capital.
      This human capital\n  consists of the worker’s knowledge base, their abilities,
      their relationship with\n  customers, and their ability to execute your business
      plan., All these components\n  add up to the intangible value of those employees
      to your business. The more talented\n  and tenured an employee, the more valuable
      he or she is to your business. You have\n  retained your talented staff after
      spending time, energy and effort to teach them\n  the knowledge necessary which
      to be useful to our business. Talent will flow to\n  its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve out areas where talented people’s best\n  &quot;use&quot;
      is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business\n
      \ enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles
      and\n  the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether they
      want one or\n  not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand
      is what your company\n  &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.
      You want your brand to mean\n  &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot;
      or &quot;delivers on time, every\n  time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to
      be perceived as, &quot;much more expensive\n  than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they
      don’t really care about their customers,&quot;\n  or &quot;they make a mess
      every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES
      mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive
      in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How
      can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n
      \ so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n
      \ King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump
      steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets
      inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another
      model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this
      aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and add powerful new ones.
      Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long
      Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales.
      When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales.
      However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products

      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual

      ! \"<h4>Congratulations, you scored above average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The\n
      \ four capitals are comprised of intellectual capital, financial capital, human
      capital\n  and brand capital. Your score is a composite average of all four
      areas. We’ll run\n  through them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      high score\n  indicates you may have some valuable intellectual capital. Every
      business sells\n  intellectual property. Intellectual property isn’t just for
      doctors, patent attorneys,\n  accountants and chip designers. Everyone is in
      the idea, or intellectual property,\n  business. If you make widgets, is it
      the generic making of the widgets that generates\n  the profit, probably not?
      More likely, it is your proprietary way of making the\n  widgets, or your secret
      vendors, or the way you train your staff that accounts for\n  the profits. These
      are all examples of intellectual property. The only true asset\n  your business
      has is the ability to generate a profit doing the things you do the\n  way you
      do them. The little secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits\n
      \ doing the same ordinary thing as the same ordinary company next door. The
      reason\n  you make money is you know a couple of little things that enable you
      to take better\n  care of your customers, buy better, or charge a little extra.
      All the little things\n  are what make up your intellectual property and what
      contribute extensively to your\n  bottom line. Therefore, the more you can grow
      your intellectual property, the more\n  intellectual capital you will have and
      the more profit you will make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  contacts and connections
      are intellectual property. Look at your Rolodex and figure\n  out what a contact
      in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these contacts are worth quite\n  a bit. Unfortunately,
      for most of us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be\n  measured in monetary
      terms. These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However,
      they don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n
      \ be translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and
      your\n  business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly
      attach a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value
      of the purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What
      is the value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say,
      &quot;Hi&quot; but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing
      to nurture and grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize
      people who could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like,
      and trust you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply
      because you have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term
      relationships you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business
      asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n
      \ capital needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve
      heard\n  the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital.
      This is true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to
      have an appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize
      on opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than
      just having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point. In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored above\n  average, your
      margins should be funding your growth vs. constantly having to borrow\n  money.
      Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate amount of debt\n  for
      any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Continue your financial diligence and
      use\n  debt as a weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong?\n  If not, what can you do with your financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance,\n  a manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot;\n  the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments.\n  He used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things you can do\n  that your financially weaker
      competitors cannot because of their financial status.\n  Consider doing one
      or more of these things to create a competitive &quot;moat&quot;\n  to protect
      you from your competition.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates\n
      \ has said, &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant
      company.&quot;\n  A great business cannot run without great people. You have
      been successful at attracting\n  and retaining top talent. You have done a good
      job competing with big businesses\n  in regard to this. Alternatively, you may
      have figured out a strategy that enables\n  you to work without &quot;superstars,&quot;
      yet still have a well-run business.\n  Keep in mind there is an asset not listed
      on your balance sheet called human capital.\n  This human capital consists of
      workers’ knowledge base, their abilities, their relationships\n  with customers,
      and their ability to execute your business plan. All these components\n  add
      up to the value of these employees to your business. The more talented and tenured\n
      \ an employee, the more valuable he or she is. You have retained your talented
      staff\n  after spending time, energy, and effort to teach them what is necessary
      to be useful\n  to your business. Talent will flow to its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve\n  out areas where talented people’s best use is working for
      you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand\n  Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business enterprises
      feel that &quot;branding&quot;\n  is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles and the Gillettes
      of the world. Every business\n  has a brand, whether they want one or not. A
      brand does not need to be overly complicated.\n  A brand is what your company
      &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.\n  You want your brand
      to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers\n  on
      time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much\n
      \ more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they don’t really care about
      their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess every time we place an order
      with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES mean something to your customers.
      Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive in their eyes. You scored well
      on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How can you make it stronger? Brands
      typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n  so be careful not to overextend
      your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n  King underwear, Kellogg’s
      hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump steaks.\n  Instead, create
      a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets inexpensive\n  Chinese-made
      cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another model under the\n  Toyota
      moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect\n
      \ your current brands and add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about
      the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature,
      more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a
      handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales. However, as the market
      matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products make up only 20% of the
      sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small businesses can’t compete
      on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on the Long Tail that we can
      &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved

      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,

      &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  is
      your Rolodex under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write down
      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&amp;D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital. During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and
      profit from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21

      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,

      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,

      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience

      &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of the parade, not behind it.
      Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be

      a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop,

      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal ball three, four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future of your company holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the\n  general environment your company

      \ future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front
      of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business
      Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How
      did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate interest from them
      during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when
      analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe what you want to
      believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      is not\n  true. They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last

      for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that information

      the masters. They\n  know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify it for
      today’s market. There are\n  two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison
      and King Gillette to create\n  a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas
      Edison had to install electric\n  lights for free in a New York high rise because
      he couldn’t get anyone to try them.\n  Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone
      to buy his safety razors. It’s hard to imagine\n  such superior products were
      not accepted by the marketplace, but it happens all\n  the time. In Gillette’s
      case, to combat consumer apathy, he created a massive network\n  of partners
      to give away his razors (the whole unit with handle and blades) for\n  free.
      Once consumers used the product, they saw the value and came back for the\n
      \ high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other
      companies\n  like Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford
      was quoted as\n  saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement
      parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,\n  a powerful business model can create an
      easier to sell product and reduce reliance\n  on an expensive sales force in
      the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:45:04.216499000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored &quot;excellent&quot; on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary\n
      \ determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill
      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, then we would actually be
      able to accomplish\n  our sales objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars
      is never the problem and\n  the quality of the sales staff is almost never the
      sales issue. Typically, the issue\n  is the salability of the product combined
      with a potential shortcoming of sales\n  talent. Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on\n  building a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"
      alt=\\\"Selling Ice to Eskimos?\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey - Area
      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are doing a good job\n  ignoring your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants, needs\n  and desires.&quot;
      Instead, you are listening to the market. Great job! You need\n  to pay attention
      to market data, not your own subjective opinions. Listening to\n  the market
      instead of listening to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy\n  to
      sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to be sold. However, some products\n
      \ need more selling and others need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n
      \ the sale. For instance, insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n
      \ tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine
      whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I
      call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example: if you could only sell
      your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would happen? This means
      no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling marketing at all.
      It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However, you have the best
      sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars. What happens
      to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now
      flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n  not even bad-sales-people
      selling. However, the best marketing team in the world\n  works with your product.
      You get all those promotional items that you currently\n  don’t have: marketing
      geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique\n  you can
      think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ truth, marketing brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to\n  you they are sometimes fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses,\n  marketing partially sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this question can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more\n  important for your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times\n  I see business owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite\n  to the sale is really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective\n  in order to
      make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy\n  to
      sell is filling an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing\n
      \ the demand for the product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself: How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your customers would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n  your answer is closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding\n  another HVAC contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product or service should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process.
      Many times we see an outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and
      perform their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just
      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does
      not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great
      sales people is\n  they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally, without knowing how they
      do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones,
      but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable and repeatable sales process.
      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is
      to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales process. Since you
      scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n  repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n  sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined? If you don’t\n  know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have an easy time\n  selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are you trying to\n  search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this, you probably\n  know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499820982468.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old saying in business,
      &quot;Find\n  a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an
      &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of the parade, not behind it.
      Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be
      out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it. Nothing is worse than being
      a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop,
      competition increases, and the market declines. These\n  are the markets you
      not only want to avoid getting into, but want to get out of.\n  You always need
      to be aware of where you are in the product development and product\n  life
      cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074471966546.jpg\\\"\n

      you sell to, and the product or service mix you offer,\n  so you can get in

      a great\n  company that does not have great margins. The two go together. You
      need to begin\n  to innovate and refine your business model to grow your margins.
      You may have bad\n  competitors crowding the marketplace and eroding your margin.
      Can you differentiate\n  your product to command higher margins? What additional
      value or features can you\n  add to the offering to allow you to charge more?
      Are there dramatic cost saving\n  opportunities? Remember, no margin, no mission.</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      may need to start\n  fresh. You will continue to struggle if you do not raise
      margins. It may be difficult\n  or impossible to modify your existing offerings
      to dramatically raise margins. If\n  this is the case, you may be better off
      to add a new offering rather than modify\n  a flawed one. Many great companies
      were born as small trial divisions of failed\n  companies. Toys'R'Us us was
      a small division of a failed retailer. CarMax was a\n  division of Circuit City.
      Consider introducing a high-margin product or service\n  that could turn into

      you\n  used to create your best margin products and services? Don’t get caught
      up in the\n  specifics of how you did it, stick to the philosophies that got
      you there. Over\n  time, all business models erode, as will yours. It will not
      be in minutes, weeks\n  or months. It will be over the course of years or decades.
      However, all business\n  models do erode over time. You need to continue to

      times these marginal products and services\n  drain company resources and don’t
      add to the bottom line significantly. Many times\n  companies can run better

      even firing customers.</p>\\r\\n<p>By firing customers, the objective\n  is
      to not only get away from customers who are a pain, but to get away from customers\n

      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In
      order\n  to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you have\n  too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or if your\n  customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have quality\n  customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      our customers overly price conscious?\n  If customers have their eye on nothing
      but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses\n  to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers who\n  are going to
      attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that cannot\n  be accomplished,
      you are selling a product which the customer perceives as somewhat\n  generic.
      You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding can allow you\n  to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a premium for some\n
      \ attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does not need to
      be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences. For example, all
      the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and
      a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In
      every business\n  relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can
      &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money,
      so they dictate many of the business\n  terms. However, you need to be able
      to dictate many dynamics in the business relationship.\n  If not, you have a
      problem. For many companies, these seemingly insignificant terms\n  add up to
      a large portion of their profits. For instance, many companies have used\n  the
      self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own\n
      \ customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are dictating terms and dramatically\n
      \ lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer,
      so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A small vendor dealing
      with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms in the same way
      as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard some business
      stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen not do business with
      companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers\n  because all the terms are
      dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n  isn’t always
      a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently provides\n  many
      dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large customers, sometimes\n
      \ they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The third consideration
      of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract them compared to their
      lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue or margin.
      Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say that the
      cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average customer stays
      only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product at a 50 % margin
      during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n  vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve\n  this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring\n
      \ the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895691906.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy
      places to find customers?\n  Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the
      product rather than using inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when
      the product simply needs to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because
      your brand lacks meaning to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak
      brand through other methodologies, such as lowering your\n  price or putting
      extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      \ Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Rank
      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have. Do they demand excessive\n  discounts even though they pay
      net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated\n  with carrying their accounts
      receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time\n  or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis\n  is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they\n  thought was their
      fourth best is actually their best customer and the one they thought\n  was
      their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult\n
      \ decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some
      customers\n  tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more
      money by not selling\n  to them. This is always a difficult realization because
      most business owners are\n  programmed to think that there is no such thing
      as a bad customer, and that anyone\n  who gives you money is a good customer.
      This is usually true. But occasionally,\n  it can be false. I encourage you
      to do a customer analysis annually to see what\n  the true margin provided by
      each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price\n  consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never\n  about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to\n  pay a
      certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features\n
      \ and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s
      add\n  value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly
      while providing\n  better value to the customer. This extra value may be in
      the form of a new or modified\n  product. For instance, make a premium version
      of your product. Figure out how to\n  add features, benefits, and attributes
      and see if that product will command a higher\n  price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate\n  ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years\n  ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market.\n
      \ These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice
      cream\n  became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never
      know what is\n  going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who
      would have figured\n  that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market
      when you can get a similar\n  cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\\r\\n\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      order\n  to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you have\n  too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or if your\n  customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have quality\n  customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even
      though you have quality customers,\n  are they still price conscious? If customers
      have their eye on nothing but price,\n  it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to remain profitable. Ideally, what needs\n  to be done is to find the customers
      who are going to attribute value to something,\n  other than sales price. If
      that cannot be accomplished, you are selling a product\n  which the customer
      perceives as somewhat generic. You need to work on your brand\n  to overcome
      this. Branding can allow you to attack a different segment of the marketplace,\n
      \ and charge a premium for some attribute other than the generic product. This
      attribute\n  does not need to be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences.
      For example,\n  all the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You
      squeeze a tube and\n  a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands
      exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In\n  every business relationship,
      one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate\n  terms.&quot; Can
      you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate\n  many of the
      business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics\n  in
      the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies, these\n
      \ seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance,\n  many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web
      to &quot;force&quot;\n  customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating\n  terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this
      is a minor &quot;term&quot;\n  to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor\n  dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same\n  way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business\n  stories about vendors that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies\n  like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers\n  are not quality customers because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A\n  quality customer
      isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently\n
      \ provides many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers,\n  sometimes they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration\n  of quality customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime\n  value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are\n  in a business with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a\n  new customer is $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell,\n  on average, $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend\n  half the lifetime value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario,\n  the cost of attraction
      vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer\n  is horrible. To
      improve this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower\n  the cost
      of acquiring the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There\n
      \ are several questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.

      \ are several questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895691906.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy
      places to find customers?\n  Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the
      product rather than using inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when
      the product simply needs to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because
      your brand lacks meaning to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak
      brand through other methodologies, such as lowering your\n  price or putting
      extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074471808695.png\\\" alt=\\\"Customer Profitability\n
      \ Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Rank
      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have. Do they demand excessive\n  discounts even though they pay
      net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated\n  with carrying their accounts
      receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time\n  or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis\n  is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they\n  thought was their
      fourth best is actually their best customer and the one they thought\n  was
      their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult\n
      \ decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some
      customers\n  tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more
      money by not selling\n  to them. This is always a difficult realization because
      most business owners are\n  programmed to think that there is no such thing
      as a bad customer, and that anyone\n  who gives you money is a good customer.
      This is usually true. But occasionally,\n  it can be false. I encourage you
      to do a customer analysis annually to see what\n  the true margin provided by
      each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price\n  consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never\n  about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to\n  pay a
      certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features\n
      \ and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s
      add\n  value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly
      while providing\n  better value to the customer. This extra value may be in
      the form of a new or modified\n  product. For instance, make a premium version
      of your product. Figure out how to\n  add features, benefits, and attributes
      and see if that product will command a higher\n  price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate\n  ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years\n  ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market.\n
      \ These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice
      cream\n  became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never
      know what is\n  going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who
      would have figured\n  that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market
      when you can get a similar\n  cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:34:15.723682000Z\nupdated_at: 2011-12-21

      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You can do a better job ignoring\n  your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants, needs and\n  desires.&quot;
      Instead, listen to the market. You should pay attention to market\n  data, not
      your own subjective opinions. Listening to the market instead of listening\n
      \ to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product needs to be sold. However, some products need more selling and others
      need\n  more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance,
      insurance\n  tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  easiest way to determine whether your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to\n  do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling marketing at all. It all\n  goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you have the best sales force\n  in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What happens to your sales?\n  Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over\n  the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people selling. However,\n
      \ the best marketing team in the world works with your product. You get all
      those\n  promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,
      Web 2.0 strategies,\n  every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented. What happens?\n  Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects\n  to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business owners\n  who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really\n
      \ the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make
      the\n  product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is filling\n  an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is\n  closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC\n  contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times\n  we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black\n  magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem
      to do it. Perhaps we give\n  them more credit than they deserve. Great sales
      people who move from company to\n  company and continue to sell well do so because
      they are great at understanding\n  how to sell products. This does not mean
      they excel at feature/benefit presentations.\n  The secret of great sales people
      is they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  of the truly
      great sales people do it naturally, without knowing how they do it.\n  They
      create a procedure, a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless,\n
      \ which result in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every
      company,\n  if you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create
      a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this,
      you probably have a\n  definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable\n  and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined?\n  If you don’t know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have\n  an easy time selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are\n  you trying to search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this,\n  you probably know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499820982468.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old saying in business,
      &quot;Find\n  a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an
      &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of the parade, not behind it.
      Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be
      out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it. Nothing is worse than being
      a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop,
      competition increases, and the market declines. These\n  are the markets you
      not only want to avoid getting into, but want to get out of.\n  You always need
      to be aware of where you are in the product development and product\n  life
      cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074471966546.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ you analyzing true, unfiltered data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting\n
      \ data to be what you want or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming
      your sales\n  people for marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you created
      a definable and repeatable\n  sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you in front
      of the parade or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If\n  you are behind the parade,
      how can you alter the customers you sell to, and the\n  product or service mix
      you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n  your
      parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade\n
      \ to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you looked at your existing prospect
      list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how you find, generate
      interest\n  from, and sell prospects? Have you gone through your prospect list
      to see if you\n  can create a process for finding more of them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal ball three, four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future of your company holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the\n  general environment your company
      will be operating in. What does this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state
      economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell\n  to look like?
      Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology\n  trends
      exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your predictions of the\n
      \ future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front
      of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business
      Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How
      did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate interest from them
      during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when
      analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe what you want to
      believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      style=\\\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 300px;\\\" />Sit\n  down with
      your best salespeople and/or your best former salespeople and pick their\n  brains.
      Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to tell you,\n
      \ &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot; This
      is not\n  true. They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last
      five big sales\n  they had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and search
      for the commonalities.\n  There will be plenty of them. Now take that information
      and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable sales process so you can elevate the
      performance of your average, and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy business\n  owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n
      \ get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his
      safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted
      by the marketplace,\n  but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer apathy, he created\n  a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole unit with handle\n  and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw the value and came\n  back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember,
      a powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce
      reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      product or service should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process.
      Many times we see an outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and
      perform their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just
      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does

      sales people is\n  they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally, without knowing how they
      do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones,
      but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable and repeatable sales process.
      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is
      to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales process. Since you
      scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n  repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n  sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined? If you don’t\n  know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have an easy time\n  selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are you trying to\n  search for a needle

      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>There is an old saying in business,
      &quot;Find\n  a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an
      &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of the parade, not behind it.
      Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be
      out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it. Nothing is worse than being
      a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop,
      competition increases, and the market declines. These\n  are the markets you
      not only want to avoid getting into, but want to get out of.\n  You always need
      to be aware of where you are in the product development and product\n  life

      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ you analyzing true, unfiltered data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting\n
      \ data to be what you want or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming

      of the parade or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If\n  you are behind the parade,
      how can you alter the customers you sell to, and the\n  product or service mix
      you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n  your
      parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade\n
      \ to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you looked at your existing prospect
      list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how you find, generate
      interest\n  from, and sell prospects? Have you gone through your prospect list
      to see if you\n  can create a process for finding more of them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal ball three, four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future of your company holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the\n  general environment your company
      will be operating in. What does this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state
      economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell\n  to look like?
      Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology\n  trends

      300px;\\\" />How\n  can you take your predictions of the future and capitalize
      on them? These predictions\n  are how you get in front of the parade. We do
      a detailed, in-depth analysis like\n  this in the Business Model Secrets course.
      Take a look at your best ten or twenty\n  customers. How did you generate them
      as prospects? How did you generate interest\n  from them during initial conversations?
      How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic\n  when analyzing this. Don’t drink
      your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want to\n  believe. Think exclusively
      from the customer’s point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down\n  with your best salespeople
      and/or your best former salespeople and pick their brains.\n  Get insight into
      the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to tell you, &quot;I\n  don’t know
      how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot; This is not true.\n  They
      used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last five big sales they\n
      \ had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and search for the commonalities.\n
      \ There will be plenty of them. Now take that information and create a company-wide,\n
      \ repeatable sales process so you can elevate the performance of your average,
      and\n  not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved
      or underserved\n  markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace
      and get ahead of the\n  competition. If you can, create new products and services
      that will be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy
      business\n  owners learn from the masters. They know how to take a 100-year-old
      idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There are two powerful ideas you can
      borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette to create a product that is easier
      to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had to install electric lights for free
      in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n  get anyone to try them. Similarly,
      Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine
      such superior products were not accepted by the marketplace,\n  but it happens
      all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat consumer apathy, he created\n  a
      massive network of partners to give away his razors (the whole unit with handle\n
      \ and blades) for free. Once consumers used the product, they saw the value
      and came\n  back for the high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy
      today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like Jell-O and Ford have used similar
      models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted as saying, &quot;I will give you the
      car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a
      powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce reliance
      on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:45:04.223705000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored &quot;excellent&quot; on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary\n
      \ determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill
      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, then we would actually be
      able to accomplish\n  our sales objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars
      is never the problem and\n  the quality of the sales staff is almost never the
      sales issue. Typically, the issue\n  is the salability of the product combined
      with a potential shortcoming of sales\n  talent. Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on\n  building a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"

      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are doing a good job\n  ignoring your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants, needs\n  and desires.&quot;
      Instead, you are listening to the market. Great job! You need\n  to pay attention
      to market data, not your own subjective opinions. Listening to\n  the market
      instead of listening to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy\n  to
      sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to be sold. However, some products\n
      \ need more selling and others need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n
      \ the sale. For instance, insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n
      \ tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine
      whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I
      call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example: if you could only sell
      your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would happen? This means
      no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling marketing at all.
      It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However, you have the best
      sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars. What happens
      to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now
      flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n  not even bad-sales-people
      selling. However, the best marketing team in the world\n  works with your product.
      You get all those promotional items that you currently\n  don’t have: marketing
      geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique\n  you can
      think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ truth, marketing brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to\n  you they are sometimes fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses,\n  marketing partially sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this question can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more\n  important for your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times\n  I see business owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite\n  to the sale is really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective\n  in order to
      make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy\n  to

      ! \"<h4>You scored &quot;low&quot; on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The primary\n
      \ determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill
      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, we would actually be able
      to accomplish our sales\n  objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars is never
      the problem and the quality\n  of the sales staff is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the\n  salability of the product combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent.\n  Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on building\n  a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"

      #2\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You can do a better job ignoring\n  your own opinions
      and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants, needs and\n  desires.&quot;
      Instead, listen to the market. You should pay attention to market\n  data, not
      your own subjective opinions. Listening to the market instead of listening\n
      \ to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product needs to be sold. However, some products need more selling and others
      need\n  more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance,
      insurance\n  tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  easiest way to determine whether your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to\n  do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling marketing at all. It all\n  goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you have the best sales force\n  in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What happens to your sales?\n  Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over\n  the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people selling. However,\n
      \ the best marketing team in the world works with your product. You get all
      those\n  promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,
      Web 2.0 strategies,\n  every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented. What happens?\n  Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects\n  to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business owners\n  who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really\n
      \ the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make
      the\n  product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is filling\n  an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is\n  closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC\n  contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times\n  we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black\n  magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem
      to do it. Perhaps we give\n  them more credit than they deserve. Great sales
      people who move from company to\n  company and continue to sell well do so because
      they are great at understanding\n  how to sell products. This does not mean
      they excel at feature/benefit presentations.\n  The secret of great sales people
      is they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  of the truly
      great sales people do it naturally, without knowing how they do it.\n  They
      create a procedure, a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless,\n
      \ which result in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every
      company,\n  if you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create
      a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this,
      you probably have a\n  definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable\n  and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined?\n  If you don’t know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have\n  an easy time selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are\n  you trying to search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this,\n  you probably know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499820982468.jpg\\\"\n

      &quot;Find\n  a parade and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an
      &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of the parade, not behind it.
      Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year life span. You want to be
      out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it. Nothing is worse than being
      a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n  this happens, prices drop,
      competition increases, and the market declines. These\n  are the markets you
      not only want to avoid getting into, but want to get out of.\n  You always need
      to be aware of where you are in the product development and product\n  life
      cycles.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074471966546.jpg\\\"\n

      list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how you find, generate

      300px;\\\" />Look into your crystal ball three, four,\n  or five years into
      the future. Don’t look at what the future of your company holds,\n  but at the
      future of your industry, and the general environment your company will\n  be
      operating in. What does this environment look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the
      general\n  economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the local and state economy
      look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  do the customers you sell to look like? Are their
      industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  technology trends exist
      in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your predictions\n  of the future
      and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front\n  of the
      parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business Model\n
      \ Secrets course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How did
      you generate\n  them as prospects? How did you generate interest from them during
      initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when analyzing
      this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe what you want to believe.
      Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down
      with your best salespeople and/or your best former\n  salespeople and pick their
      brains. Get insight into the processes they used. They’ll\n  be inclined to
      tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just went in and sold\n  stuff.&quot;
      This is not true. They used a process. Ask them to describe, in detail,\n  the
      last five big sales they had, step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and\n
      \ search for the commonalities. There will be plenty of them. Now take that
      information\n  and create a company-wide, repeatable sales process so you can
      elevate the performance\n  of your average, and not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm
      what new unserved\n  or underserved markets are going to be upcoming trends
      in your marketplace and get\n  ahead of the competition. If you can, create
      new products and services that will\n  be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n  business owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from\n  Thomas Edison and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas\n  Edison had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he\n  couldn’t
      get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy\n  his
      safety razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted\n
      \ by the marketplace, but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer\n  apathy, he created a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole\n  unit with handle and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw\n  the value and came back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy\n  today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models.\n  In fact, Henry Ford was quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just\n  buy the replacement
      parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a powerful business model can\n  create an
      easier to sell product and reduce reliance on an expensive sales force\n  in
      the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:45:04.216499000Z\nupdated_at:

      new products and services that will\n  be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n  business owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from\n  Thomas Edison and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas\n  Edison had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he\n  couldn’t
      get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy\n  his
      safety razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted\n
      \ by the marketplace, but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer\n  apathy, he created a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole\n  unit with handle and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw\n  the value and came back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy\n  today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models.\n  In fact, Henry Ford was quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just\n  buy the replacement
      parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a powerful business model can\n  create an
      easier to sell product and reduce reliance on an expensive sales force\n  in
      the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:45:04.223705000Z\nupdated_at:

      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is

      to yourself is a great tactic to use to create an easy-to-sell\n  product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product needs to be sold. However, some products need more\n  selling and others
      need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale.\n  For instance,
      insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to\n  be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine whether your\n  product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;\n
      \ Here is an example: if you could only sell your product and were allowed NO
      marketing,\n  what would happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling\n  marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you\n  have the best sales force in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What\n  happens to your sales? Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now\n  flip over the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people\n  selling.
      However, the best marketing team in the world works with your product.\n  You
      get all those promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,\n
      \ Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented.\n  What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing\n  brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes\n  fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially\n  sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question\n  can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for\n  your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business\n  owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is\n  really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to\n  make
      the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is\n  filling an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand\n  for the product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product\n  is easier to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours\n  ends up being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself: How would your customers

      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does

      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is

      your crystal ball three, four, or five years into the future. Don’t look at\n
      \ what the future of your company holds, but at the future of your industry,
      and the\n  general environment your company will be operating in. What does
      this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the general economy look
      like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      do the customers you sell\n  to look like? Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      technology\n  trends exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your
      predictions of the\n  future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how
      you get in front of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like
      this in the Business Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or
      twenty customers. How did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate
      interest from them during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be
      very pragmatic when analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe
      what you want to believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of
      view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down with your best salespeople and/or your best former\n
      \ salespeople and pick their brains. Get insight into the processes they used.
      They’ll\n  be inclined to tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just
      went in and sold\n  stuff.&quot; This is not true. They used a process. Ask
      them to describe, in detail,\n  the last five big sales they had, step by step,
      play by play, inch by inch, and\n  search for the commonalities. There will
      be plenty of them. Now take that information\n  and create a company-wide, repeatable
      sales process so you can elevate the performance\n  of your average, and not
      so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved\n  or underserved
      markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace and get\n  ahead
      of the competition. If you can, create new products and services that will\n
      \ be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n
      \ business owners learn from the masters. They know how to take a 100-year-old
      idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There are two powerful ideas you can
      borrow from\n  Thomas Edison and King Gillette to create a product that is easier
      to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas\n  Edison had to install electric lights for free
      in a New York high rise because he\n  couldn’t get anyone to try them. Similarly,
      Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy\n  his safety razors. It’s hard to imagine
      such superior products were not accepted\n  by the marketplace, but it happens
      all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat consumer\n  apathy, he created a
      massive network of partners to give away his razors (the whole\n  unit with
      handle and blades) for free. Once consumers used the product, they saw\n  the
      value and came back for the high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy\n
      \ today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other companies like Jell-O and Ford have used similar
      models.\n  In fact, Henry Ford was quoted as saying, &quot;I will give you the
      car if you just\n  buy the replacement parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a
      powerful business model can\n  create an easier to sell product and reduce reliance
      on an expensive sales force\n  in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      ! \"<h4>You scored low on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates is quoted as saying,
      &quot;Without our\n  top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant company.&quot;
      A great business\n  cannot run without great people and your business has been
      successful attracting\n  and retaining top talent. You may have struggled competing
      with big businesses regarding\n  this. Have you figured out a strategy to work
      without &quot;superstars&quot; yet\n  still have a well-running business? This
      is a &quot;must for many small businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep\n  in mind that
      there is an asset, not list on your balance sheet, called human capital.\n  This
      human capital consists of the worker’s knowledge base, their abilities, their\n
      \ relationship with customers, and their ability to execute your business plan.,
      All\n  these components add up to the intangible value of those employees to
      your business.\n  The more talented and tenured an employee, the more valuable
      he or she is to your\n  business. You have retained your talented staff after
      spending time, energy and\n  effort to teach them the knowledge necessary which
      to be useful to our business.\n  Talent will flow to its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve out areas where\n  talented people’s best &quot;use&quot;
      is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  business-to-business
      enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor\n  &amp; Gambles
      and the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether\n  they
      want one or not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand is\n
      \ what your company &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple. You
      want\n  your brand to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or
      &quot;delivers\n  on time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be
      perceived as, &quot;much\n  more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they
      don’t really care about their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess
      every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES
      mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive
      in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How
      can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n
      \ so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n
      \ King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump
      steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets
      inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another
      model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this
      aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and add powerful new ones.
      Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long
      Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales.
      When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales.
      However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products
      make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small
      businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on
      the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  is
      your Rolodex under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write down
      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital.During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and profit
      from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-18 00:44:49.399686000Z\nupdated_at:

      principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products
      make up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may
      comprise 80% of the sales. However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n
      \ or winning products make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises
      80%.\n  Most small businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should
      pick a place\n  on the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      ! \"<h4>Congratulations, you scored well on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four\n
      \ capitals are comprised of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial
      capital,\n  human capital and brand capital. Your score is a composite average
      of all four areas.\n  We’ll run through them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual
      Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  high score indicates you have some valuable intellectual
      capital. Every business\n  sells intellectual property. Intellectual property
      isn’t just for doctors, patent\n  attorneys, accountants and chip designers.
      Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual\n  property, business. If you make
      widgets, is it the generic making of the widgets\n  that generates the profit,
      probably not? More likely, it is your proprietary way\n  of making the widgets,
      or your secret vendors, or the way you train your staff that\n  account for
      the profits. These are all examples of intellectual property. The only\n  true
      asset your business has is the ability to generate a profit doing the things\n
      \ you do the way you do them. The little secrets and tricks are what allow you
      to\n  make profits doing the same ordinary thing as the same ordinary company
      next door.\n  The reason you make money is you know a couple of little things
      that enable you\n  to take better care of your customers, buy better, or charge
      a little extra. All\n  the little things are what make up your intellectual
      property and what contribute\n  extensively to your bottom line. Therefore,
      the more you can grow your intellectual\n  property, the more intellectual capital
      you will have and the more profit you will\n  make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts
      and connections are intellectual property. Look at\n  your Rolodex and figure
      out what a contact in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these\n  contacts are worth
      quite a bit. Unfortunately, for most of us, many of the contacts\n  in a Rolodex
      cannot be measured in monetary terms. These folks may be great friends,\n  great
      customers, whatever. However, they don’t necessarily add to your bottom line.\n
      \ Though these people cannot be translated directly into money, they are incredibly\n
      \ valuable to you and your business. If you lose the relationship with them,
      you can\n  certainly attach a negative dollar value on the loss. For instance,
      what is the\n  value of the purchasing agent at your best customer who genuinely
      likes you? What\n  is the value of your old college roommate who calls you once
      a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;\n  but introduces you to some great vendors? What
      are you doing to nurture and grow\n  those relationships? What are you doing
      to better utilize people who could be more\n  helpful to you? There are people
      that know, like, and trust you who may not be adding\n  value to you or your
      business simply because you have not asked. Is there a way\n  that you can leverage
      the long-term relationships you have with these people and\n  turn them into
      a valuable business asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex\n  capital?
      What new Rolodex capital needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve\n
      \ heard the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital.
      This is\n  true not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to
      have an appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize
      on opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than
      just having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point. In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well,\n  your margins
      should be funding your growth vs. constantly having to borrow money.\n  Debt
      is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate amount of debt for any\n
      \ business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Continue your financial diligence and
      use\n  debt as a weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong?\n  If not, what can you do with your financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance,\n  a manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot;\n  the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments.\n  He used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things you can do\n  that your financially weaker
      competitors cannot because of their financial status.\n  Consider doing one
      or more of these things to create a competitive &quot;moat&quot;\n  to protect
      you from your competition.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates has said, &quot;Without
      our top 20 people,\n  Microsoft would be an insignificant company.&quot; A great
      business cannot run without\n  great people. You have been successful at attracting
      and retaining top talent. You\n  have done a good job competing with big businesses
      in regard to this. Alternatively,\n  you may have figured out a strategy that
      enables you to work without &quot;superstars,&quot;\n  yet still have a well-run
      business. Keep in mind there is an asset not listed on\n  your balance sheet
      called human capital. This human capital consists of workers’\n  knowledge base,
      their abilities, their relationships with customers, and their ability\n  to
      execute your business plan. All these components add up to the value of these\n
      \ employees to your business. The more talented and tenured an employee, the
      more\n  valuable he or she is. You have retained your talented staff after spending
      time,\n  energy, and effort to teach them what is necessary to be useful to
      your business.\n  Talent will flow to its highest and best use. Continue to
      carve out areas where\n  talented people’s best use is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand
      Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  business-to-business enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot;
      is for the Proctor\n  &amp; Gambles and the Gillettes of the world. Every business
      has a brand, whether\n  they want one or not. A brand does not need to be overly
      complicated. A brand is\n  what your company &quot;means&quot; to your customers.
      It’s that simple. You want\n  your brand to mean &quot;excellent service and
      great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers\n  on time, every time.&quot; You don’t
      want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much\n  more expensive than I thought,&quot;
      or &quot;they don’t really care about their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they
      make a mess every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n
      \ brand DOES mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n
      \ positive in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n
      \ How can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to
      the customer,\n  so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas
      include: Burger\n  King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy
      drink, and Trump steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance,
      Toyota markets inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather
      than adding another model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you
      scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and
      add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the
      principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products

      alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You\n  have some work to do creating
      additional competitive landscape. Consider the finer\n  points below to improve
      your ongoing competitive advantage.</p>\\r\\n<p>An excellent\n  model for creating
      ongoing competitive advantage contains:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Customer\n
      \ Exit Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The Hotel California.</em>
      Like\n  the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you like, but you can
      never leave.&quot;\n  Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective at making
      it contractually or emotionally\n  difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning
      the standard.</em> Microsoft owns\n  many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office, you may be hurting yourself\n  more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able to share a standardized format\n  document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors. You may not like MS Office,\n  but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it. Many industrial companies besides\n  Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the standard. If you can accomplish this,\n
      \ it is difficult or impossible for your customers to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n\n
      \ \\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching cost.</em> Once you have spent a million dollars
      implementing\n  SAP software, you are less likely to switch to a different software
      company because\n  of the cost and headache involved. Find ways to build switching
      cost into your product\n  or service. Switching cost can take the form of dollar
      cost, emotional cost, organizational\n  inertia, or risk, individually or in
      any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low\n  value gained by switching.</em>
      Remember when you could switch long distance companies\n  and cut your bill
      in half? It was a bit of a hassle to switch, but the savings were\n  huge. These
      days, you save virtually nothing by switching long-distance carriers.\n  That’s
      why telemarketers are no longer calling to get you to switch long distance\n
      \ companies. It simply doesn’t result in enough savings for you to go to the
      bother.\n  Keep your pricing and value bundle close to that of your competition
      so the switching\n  cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>
      Nothing says, &quot;You can't\n  quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations can be difficult and sometimes\n  a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want to sell your business someday,\n  get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more accurately determined with\n  a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts with the best vendor\n  terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want
      to stock it, there goes 35% of\n  the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Continuous
      R&amp;D needed. Your R&amp;D spending may\n  serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to
      protect you from competitors. If ongoing R&D spending\n  is needed, an under-funded
      competitor will not be able to continue spending after\n  their initial entry
      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex

      \ ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor
      entry\n  barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape.
      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>How would you rate your current competitive advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>Will\n
      \ you be able to sustain your competitive advantage? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>What is
      the single\n  most important action you can take to improve your competitive
      advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage?
      Can it be mitigated? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you create customer exit barriers?
      How long would this increase average retention?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  can you
      do to erect a &quot;moat&quot; around your business by creating competitor\n
      \ entry barriers?</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895808882.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down the names of\n  your five best customers. Assume a competitor is aggressively
      targeting those five\n  customers. The competitor will do everything in their
      power to steal those customers\n  from you. What will you do to stop this from
      happening? Pick the top two action\n  items that will aid in retaining each
      customer and do them! If any of these action\n  items are organizational improvements,
      implement them organization-wide.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently\n  enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer.\n  Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone\n
      \ assign someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of
      your competitors\n  if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      powerful\n  technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo
      Hunt&quot; to\n  a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where
      we look long and\n  hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start
      all over again. Not only\n  is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a
      business this way. There are proven\n  methods to move away from the Buffalo
      Hunt and toward a recurring revenue model.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:30:15.833709000Z\nupdated_at:

      model for creating ongoing\n  competitive advantage contains:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Customer
      Exit Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The\n  Hotel California.</em>
      Like the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you like,\n  but you can
      never leave.&quot; Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective at\n  making
      it contractually or emotionally difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning\n
      \ the standard.</em> Microsoft owns many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office,\n  you may be hurting yourself more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able\n  to share a standardized format document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors.\n  You may not like MS Office, but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it.\n  Many industrial companies besides Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the\n  standard. If you can accomplish this,
      it is difficult or impossible for your customers\n  to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching
      cost.</em> Once you have\n  spent a million dollars implementing SAP software,
      you are less likely to switch\n  to a different software company because of
      the cost and headache involved. Find\n  ways to build switching cost into your
      product or service. Switching cost can take\n  the form of dollar cost, emotional
      cost, organizational inertia, or risk, individually\n  or in any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low
      value gained by switching.</em>\n  Remember when you could switch long distance
      companies and cut your bill in half?\n  It was a bit of a hassle to switch,
      but the savings were huge. These days, you save\n  virtually nothing by switching
      long-distance carriers. That’s why telemarketers\n  are no longer calling to
      get you to switch long distance companies. It simply doesn’t\n  result in enough
      savings for you to go to the bother. Keep your pricing and value\n  bundle close
      to that of your competition so the switching cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>\n
      \ Nothing says, &quot;You can't quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations\n  can be difficult and sometimes a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want\n  to sell your business someday, get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more\n  accurately determined with a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts\n  with the best vendor terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want
      to stock it, there goes 35% of\n  the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Continuous
      R&amp;D needed. Your R&amp;D spending may\n  serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to
      protect you from competitors. If ongoing R&D spending\n  is needed, an under-funded
      competitor will not be able to continue spending after\n  their initial entry
      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex
      or contacts. Your lifelong relationships with people that know, like, and\n
      \ trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Access to capital.
      Sometimes\n  the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>First\n

      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n

      down the names of\n  your five best customers. Assume a competitor is aggressively
      targeting those five\n  customers. The competitor will do everything in their

      implement them organization-wide.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently\n  enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer.\n  Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone\n
      \ assign someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of
      your competitors\n  if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      powerful\n  technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo
      Hunt&quot; to\n  a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where
      we look long and\n  hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start
      all over again. Not only\n  is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a
      business this way. There are proven\n  methods to move away from the Buffalo
      Hunt and toward a recurring revenue model.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:30:15.845582000Z\nupdated_at:

      order\n  to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you have\n  too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or if your\n  customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have quality\n  customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      our customers overly price conscious?\n  If customers have their eye on nothing
      but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses\n  to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers who\n  are going to
      attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that cannot\n  be accomplished,
      you are selling a product which the customer perceives as somewhat\n  generic.
      You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding can allow you\n  to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a premium for some\n
      \ attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does not need to
      be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences. For example, all
      the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and
      a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In
      every business\n  relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can
      &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money,
      so they dictate many of the business\n  terms. However, you need to be able
      to dictate many dynamics in the business relationship.\n  If not, you have a
      problem. For many companies, these seemingly insignificant terms\n  add up to
      a large portion of their profits. For instance, many companies have used\n  the
      self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own\n
      \ customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are dictating terms and dramatically\n
      \ lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer,
      so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A small vendor dealing
      with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms in the same way
      as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard some business
      stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen not do business with
      companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers\n  because all the terms are
      dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n  isn’t always
      a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently provides\n  many
      dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large customers, sometimes\n
      \ they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The third consideration
      of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract them compared to their
      lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue or margin.
      Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say that the
      cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average customer stays
      only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product at a 50 % margin
      during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n  vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve\n  this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring\n
      \ the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895691906.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy
      places to find customers?\n  Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the
      product rather than using inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when
      the product simply needs to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because
      your brand lacks meaning to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak
      brand through other methodologies, such as lowering your\n  price or putting
      extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1325876401721778.png\\\" alt=\\\"Customer Profitability\n
      \ Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Rank
      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have. Do they demand excessive\n  discounts even though they pay
      net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated\n  with carrying their accounts
      receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time\n  or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis\n  is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they\n  thought was their
      fourth best is actually their best customer and the one they thought\n  was
      their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult\n
      \ decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some
      customers\n  tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more
      money by not selling\n  to them. This is always a difficult realization because
      most business owners are\n  programmed to think that there is no such thing
      as a bad customer, and that anyone\n  who gives you money is a good customer.
      This is usually true. But occasionally,\n  it can be false. I encourage you
      to do a customer analysis annually to see what\n  the true margin provided by
      each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price\n  consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never\n  about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to\n  pay a
      certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features\n
      \ and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s
      add\n  value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly
      while providing\n  better value to the customer. This extra value may be in
      the form of a new or modified\n  product. For instance, make a premium version
      of your product. Figure out how to\n  add features, benefits, and attributes
      and see if that product will command a higher\n  price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate\n  ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years\n  ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market.\n
      \ These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice
      cream\n  became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never
      know what is\n  going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who
      would have figured\n  that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market
      when you can get a similar\n  cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\\r\\n\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n

      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books who were purposely forfeited by\n  your

      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,

      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have.</p>\\r\\n<p>Do they demand\n  excessive discounts even though
      they pay net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital\n  associated with carrying
      their accounts receivable balance versus a customer that\n  pays on time or
      C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What you will find after running this customer\n  cost analysis
      is the customer rankings will change. Many people find out that the\n  customer
      they thought was their fourth best is actually their best customer, and\n  the
      one they thought was their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead\n
      \ you to some difficult decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers.
      You\n  may find that some customers tax the organization to such an extent that
      you will\n  make more money by not selling to them. This is always a difficult
      realization because\n  most business owners are programmed to think that there
      is no such thing as a bad\n  customer, and that anyone who gives you money is
      a good customer. This is usually\n  true. But occasionally, it can be false.
      I encourage you to do a customer analysis\n  annually to see what is the true
      margin provided by each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we determine the extent\n  of your customers’
      price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot;\n  it’s
      almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer\n
      \ is only going to pay a certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based
      upon\n  the value of features and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather
      than just lowering\n  price, let’s add value instead. This can be a great way
      to increase the price slightly\n  while providing better value to the customer.
      This extra value may be in the form\n  of a new or modified product. For instance,
      make a premium version of your product.\n  Figure out how to add features, benefits,
      and attributes and see if that product\n  will command a higher price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular\n  ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream\n  market twenty years ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny\n  segment of the market.
      These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before\n  long, premium ice
      cream became a very large segment of the total ice cream market.\n  You never
      know what is going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode.\n  Who
      would have figured that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market\n
      \ when you can get a similar cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:34:15.717899000Z\nupdated_at: 2012-01-06

      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In
      order\n  to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers.
      If you have\n  too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot
      pay you, or if your\n  customers are so difficult they strain the organization,
      you do not have quality\n  customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will
      force you to devote precious\n  organizational resources to activities that
      do not grow your business. Fortunately,\n  you do not have many of these issues.
      Your focus can move toward adding even higher\n  quality customers and retaining
      the ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations\n  on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even
      though you have quality customers,\n  are they still price conscious? If customers
      have their eye on nothing but price,\n  it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to remain profitable. Ideally, what needs\n  to be done is to find the customers
      who are going to attribute value to something,\n  other than sales price. If
      that cannot be accomplished, you are selling a product\n  which the customer
      perceives as somewhat generic. You need to work on your brand\n  to overcome
      this. Branding can allow you to attack a different segment of the marketplace,\n
      \ and charge a premium for some attribute other than the generic product. This
      attribute\n  does not need to be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences.
      For example,\n  all the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You
      squeeze a tube and\n  a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands
      exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In\n  every business relationship,
      one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate\n  terms.&quot; Can
      you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate\n  many of the
      business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics\n  in
      the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies, these\n
      \ seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance,\n  many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web
      to &quot;force&quot;\n  customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating\n  terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this
      is a minor &quot;term&quot;\n  to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor\n  dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same\n  way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business\n  stories about vendors that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies\n  like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers\n  are not quality customers because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A\n  quality customer
      isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently\n
      \ provides many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers,\n  sometimes they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration\n  of quality customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime\n  value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are\n  in a business with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a\n  new customer is $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell,\n  on average, $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend\n  half the lifetime value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario,\n  the cost of attraction
      vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer\n  is horrible. To
      improve this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower\n  the cost
      of acquiring the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There\n
      \ are several questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>What\n
      \ is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers is difficult
      for every\n  business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening a Cheesecake
      Factory here.&quot;\n  I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory opened
      in my hometown, the lines\n  were incredibly long, even during non-peak times.
      They had two-hour waits at 2pm\n  on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who\n  told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory.\n  He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store\n  opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story\n  is, even the businesses
      that are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have\n  worked hard to
      get them.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895691906.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do you know the easy
      places to find customers?\n  Are you paying expensive sales people to sell the
      product rather than using inexpensive\n  marketing? Are you over-marketing when
      the product simply needs to be sold? Do you\n  need a branding makeover because
      your brand lacks meaning to the customer? Are you\n  compensating for your weak
      brand through other methodologies, such as lowering your\n  price or putting
      extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be

      ! \"<h4>You scored above average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>In an excellent\n
      \ business model pitfalls are absent. Pitfalls can take many forms. For example,
      having\n  too many eggs in one customer’s basket, the government shutting you
      down, or removal\n  of subsidies. Alternatively, you could be in a market that
      is ripe for the entry\n  of large competitors. Imagine you had a spell check
      product that could be used with\n  Windows and Microsoft decided they would

      instantly. The pitfall could be nothing more than\n  a hot market cooling off
      or a trendy product that has a short life span. Ideally,\n  you should stay
      away from trends, especially short-lived trends, if your model does\n  not have
      a plan to deal with them. Some companies, like clothiers, deal with trends\n
      \ all the time, but they know they need to move from one trend to the other.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey - Area #8\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      point of concern\n  is when the business owner doesn’t like to &quot;deal with
      the money.&quot; Some\n  of these types of owners have abdicated financial control
      of their business. At\n  a minimum, you should always hand sign your checks.
      This will give you some control\n  over the money. You can delegate 98% of the
      financial function, but the high-level\n  ownership role (a.k.a. CEO Emeritus)
      should keep at least 2% of financial control.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n  instance, playing
      the role of the true CFO, maintaining the banking relationship,\n  or maintaining
      the high-level financial relationships are CEO Emeritus roles. You\n  should
      have a level of understanding of your key performance indicators (KPIs),\n  your
      profitability, as well as your balance sheet in order to have a truly great\n
      \ business and business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another potential pitfall is location.
      You’ve\n  heard the real estate adage, location, location, location. In a business
      to business\n  environment, location isn’t necessarily a handicap. However,
      most businesses pull\n  their labor force from within a tight radius of their
      physical location. If you\n  cannot find qualified personnel due to your location,
      you could have a problem hiring\n  and recruiting talented people.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      happens if the price of gasoline\n  goes to $10 a gallon resulting in a huge
      shipping problem? I was in a business where\n  we had a very heavy product which
      limited us to a 500 mile shipping radius. Plus,\n  it was a deposit-type product,
      so there were two-way freight charges. If gas prices\n  went to $10 a gallon,
      we would have to reduce the shipping radius from 500 hundred\n  miles to 250
      miles and lose all the metropolitan areas outside of the 250 mile radius.\n
      \ Does your existing business plan accommodate these types of issues?</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n
      \ Pitfall section contains a special component called the &quot;Taser Test.&quot;\n
      \ Taser has a terrific business model. Their stun guns are a highly proprietary
      product.\n  They invented the market for stun guns. It’s a very high-margin
      product. It’s a\n  beloved brand. Taser has everything going for it - other
      than a lawsuit filed every\n  month for several million dollars. Even if Taser
      wins most of these lawsuits, which\n  they do, they still have an incredible
      legal bill. Taser has to budget for this\n  legal bill and it eats into their
      profits substantially. It doesn’t matter if they\n  win or lose; they are going
      to get sued regularly. Does your business have a similar\n  issue? Are you going
      to be prone to lawsuits or unnecessary expenses simply because\n  of the business
      model that you are operating?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Are\n
      \ there pitfalls in your business model? Your first inclination is to say, &quot;No.&quot;\n
      \ This is the fair and accurate 90% of the time. Is there a way to mitigate
      or eliminate\n  any and all pitfalls? Let’s go back to Taser. If Taser could
      push through legislation\n  which said Taser is a valuable asset to law enforcement,
      and therefore any Taser\n  used in law enforcement is automatically immune from
      any lawsuit, how would that\n  alter Taser’s business model? Substantially,
      right? Is there a similar change you\n  can make to your model?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Find yourself a sounding-board\n  partner to do the following
      exercise. It is known by you and your partner that it\n  is possible to remove
      any pitfalls that may exist in your business. How does this\n  happen? Remember,
      it’s KNOWN to be possible. No, &quot;yeah but&quot; excuses! No,\n  &quot;I
      can’t because.&quot; It IS possible to remove or greatly mitigate all pitfalls\n
      \ in your business. How does this come about from where you are currently? What
      does\n  this picture look like? Think long and hard, use the sounding-board
      partner, and\n  be nothing but positive.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Mitigating
      pitfalls\n  can be difficult. Many CEOs say, &quot;There is nothing I can do
      about this.&quot;\n  Here is a great example of a Business Model Secrets program
      success story. This\n  particular client used a tremendous amount of extruded
      aluminum. As commodity prices\n  fluctuated wildly, he was losing money on some
      bids because his quote to the customer\n  was a fixed price but his raw materials
      cost went up or down unpredictably. As a\n  solution to this issue, we convinced
      him to purchase a futures contract on aluminum.\n  If prices went up, he would
      lose money on aluminum purchases, but he would make\n  it back on the futures
      contract. If prices went down, he would lose money on the\n  futures contract
      but get cost savings. This technique effectively removed the pitfall.</p>\\r\\n<p>There\n
      \ are also several quick and easy legal tricks to dramatically lower risk. One
      of\n  them costs only $100. We discuss these methods in the Business Model Secrets
      Advanced\n  Course.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:51:20.678917000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored above average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>In an excellent\n
      \ business model pitfalls are absent. Pitfalls can take many forms. For example,
      having\n  too many eggs in one customer’s basket, the government shutting you
      down, or removal\n  of subsidies. Alternatively, you could be in a market that
      is ripe for the entry\n  of large competitors. Imagine you had a spell check
      product that could be used with\n  Windows and Microsoft decided they would
      create their own spell check product. This\n  could put you out of business
      instantly. The pitfall could be nothing more than\n  a hot market cooling off
      or a trendy product that has a short life span. Ideally,\n  you should stay
      away from trends, especially short-lived trends, if your model does\n  not have
      a plan to deal with them. Some companies, like clothiers, deal with trends\n
      \ all the time, but they know they need to move from one trend to the other.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey - Area #8\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      point of concern\n  is when the business owner doesn’t like to &quot;deal with
      the money.&quot; Some\n  of these types of owners have abdicated financial control
      of their business. At\n  a minimum, you should always hand sign your checks.
      This will give you some control\n  over the money. You can delegate 98% of the
      financial function, but the high-level\n  ownership role (a.k.a. CEO Emeritus)
      should keep at least 2% of financial control.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n  instance, playing
      the role of the true CFO, maintaining the banking relationship,\n  or maintaining
      the high-level financial relationships are CEO Emeritus roles. You\n  should
      have a level of understanding of your key performance indicators (KPIs),\n  your
      profitability, as well as your balance sheet in order to have a truly great\n
      \ business and business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another potential pitfall is location.
      You’ve\n  heard the real estate adage, location, location, location. In a business
      to business\n  environment, location isn’t necessarily a handicap. However,
      most businesses pull\n  their labor force from within a tight radius of their
      physical location. If you\n  cannot find qualified personnel due to your location,
      you could have a problem hiring\n  and recruiting talented people.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      happens if the price of gasoline\n  goes to $10 a gallon resulting in a huge
      shipping problem? I was in a business where\n  we had a very heavy product which
      limited us to a 500 mile shipping radius. Plus,\n  it was a deposit-type product,
      so there were two-way freight charges. If gas prices\n  went to $10 a gallon,
      we would have to reduce the shipping radius from 500 hundred\n  miles to 250
      miles and lose all the metropolitan areas outside of the 250 mile radius.\n
      \ Does your existing business plan accommodate these types of issues?</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n
      \ Pitfall section contains a special component called the &quot;Taser Test.&quot;\n
      \ Taser has a terrific business model. Their stun guns are a highly proprietary
      product.\n  They invented the market for stun guns. It’s a very high-margin
      product. It’s a\n  beloved brand. Taser has everything going for it - other
      than a lawsuit filed every\n  month for several million dollars. Even if Taser
      wins most of these lawsuits, which\n  they do, they still have an incredible
      legal bill. Taser has to budget for this\n  legal bill and it eats into their
      profits substantially. It doesn’t matter if they\n  win or lose; they are going
      to get sued regularly. Does your business have a similar\n  issue? Are you going
      to be prone to lawsuits or unnecessary expenses simply because\n  of the business
      model that you are operating?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Are\n
      \ there pitfalls in your business model? Your first inclination is to say, &quot;No.&quot;\n
      \ This is the fair and accurate 90% of the time. Is there a way to mitigate
      or eliminate\n  any and all pitfalls? Let’s go back to Taser. If Taser could
      push through legislation\n  which said Taser is a valuable asset to law enforcement,
      and therefore any Taser\n  used in law enforcement is automatically immune from
      any lawsuit, how would that\n  alter Taser’s business model? Substantially,
      right? Is there a similar change you\n  can make to your model?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action
      Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Find yourself a sounding-board\n  partner to do the following
      exercise. It is known by you and your partner that it\n  is possible to remove
      any pitfalls that may exist in your business. How does this\n  happen? Remember,
      it’s KNOWN to be possible. No, &quot;yeah but&quot; excuses! No,\n  &quot;I
      can’t because.&quot; It IS possible to remove or greatly mitigate all pitfalls\n
      \ in your business. How does this come about from where you are currently? What
      does\n  this picture look like? Think long and hard, use the sounding-board
      partner, and\n  be nothing but positive.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Mitigating
      pitfalls\n  can be difficult. Many CEOs say, &quot;There is nothing I can do
      about this.&quot;\n  Here is a great example of a Business Model Secrets program
      success story. This\n  particular client used a tremendous amount of extruded
      aluminum. As commodity prices\n  fluctuated wildly, he was losing money on some
      bids because his quote to the customer\n  was a fixed price but his raw materials
      cost went up or down unpredictably. As a\n  solution to this issue, we convinced
      him to purchase a futures contract on aluminum.\n  If prices went up, he would
      lose money on aluminum purchases, but he would make\n  it back on the futures
      contract. If prices went down, he would lose money on the\n  futures contract
      but get cost savings. This technique effectively removed the pitfall.</p>\\r\\n<p>There\n
      \ are also several quick and easy legal tricks to dramatically lower risk. One
      of\n  them costs only $100. We discuss these methods in the Business Model Secrets
      Advanced\n  Course.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:51:20.684286000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored below average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Most business\n
      \ owners have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their working
      lives\n  are spent in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs to be
      a significant\n  asset for you and your family. I believe every business owner
      should be able to\n  sell their business for a financially meaningful sum.  That
      sum is to be defined\n  by you. It needs to be enough so you will never need
      to work again if you do not\n  want to. Let’s say the amount is $50 million.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      you put your business\n  up for sale today, could you sell it for that? Most
      business owners think their\n  businesses are worth more than they actually
      are. Here is an exercise I suggest\n  you do.</p>\\r\\nI<p>magine I work for
      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50\n  million to buy businesses.
      You and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business\n  right now. I’m going
      to pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business\n  for, $5
      million, $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank.\n
      \ You have a party; you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The CEO Emeritus
      never needs to sell\n  his/her business. The CEO Emeritus creates a business
      that runs very well without\n  their direct daily input. The CEO Emeritus works
      the hours that she wants to work,\n  gets paid a terrific salary (what you earn
      right now or maybe more), does work that\n  she wants to do, and performs activities
      only an owner can; like being the head\n  cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist,
      the keeper of key customer relationships,\n  and the standard bearer. We call
      the CEO Emeritus Activities &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot;\n  Our Business Model Secrets
      Advanced Course covers The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n  instance,
      the Standard Bearer is the person that maintains the level of how well\n  the
      organization performs all work. Have you ever noticed your business runs better\n
      \ when you are in the building versus when you are not? That’s the Standard
      Bearer\n  dynamic at work. It’s not that you are doing anything; it’s just running
      better\n  because you are present. Your people know the standard is higher when
      you are in\n  the building. Bearing the standard is an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All
      of The 16 Hats\n  activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds or thousands of
      dollars per hour, and\n  they don’t take much time. The reason is that the true
      value of the CEO is these\n  infrequent, high-value activities which only the
      CEO can perform. The CEO Emeritus\n  that does a few high-value, low-frequency
      activities and can draw a terrific amount\n  of money out of the business without
      investing tremendous amounts of time. I encourage\n  you to consider the option
      of becoming the CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business.\n  For most business
      owners, it is more financially viable to become a CEO Emeritus\n  than it is
      to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is your business truly\n
      \ saleable for top dollar? Many small businesses sell for three to five times
      their\n  earnings. If you are in one of these businesses it makes a lot more
      sense to create\n  a CEO Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity
      rather than cashing\n  out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates
      a question: In order to create\n  an exit strategy, is your business better
      situated for you to sell it or for you\n  to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      CEO has some work to do to maximize\n  the value of their business. Whether
      you are working to maximize the value of the\n  business for sale to an outside
      party, or working to maximize the value of the income\n  stream for yourself,
      many of the activities overlap. However, if you create a business\n  you can
      run as a CEO Emeritus, you will have created a far more saleable business\n
      \ that will command a much higher price-to-earnings multiple. Therefore, I recommend\n
      \ working towards CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside. If you sell your
      business,\n  it will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus. If you decide
      not to sell,\n  you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      systems or processes\n  are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming
      CEO Emeritus? The simplest\n  way to find out is to physically remove yourself
      from the business premises and\n  figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t
      there. These issues are the first systems\n  that need to be tightened up. Do
      you have the proper people in place for you to\n  assume the role of CEO Emeritus,
      or do you have some holes on your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  issue is never as
      simple as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s almost always a system\n  issue instead.
      Systems are much easier to control than people, so I encourage you\n  to start
      with the systems instead of the people. I think you will find your people\n
      \ will get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times
      we are\n  missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the
      CEO Emeritus role.\n  What role would this person fill? How much will you need
      to pay them? Is your need\n  for control holding you back from assuming the
      CEO Emeritus role? Is your need to\n  be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building a great\n  business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What\n  does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million look like? How much\n  money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO do every day, week,\n
      \ and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What are the differences\n
      \ between that business and yours? Write down five things that need to happen
      in order\n  for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get to work
      on one or two\n  of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make
      your business’ worth\n  to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million check, so keep it up.\n  Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not only build a great business,\n  but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have an outstanding, proprietary\n  business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n
      \ do you need to do to tweak your business model so your business is worth $20
      million?\n  Focus on number one and number two of the &quot;A&quot; categories
      (excellent margins\n  and easy to sell) of Business Model Secrets. If you have
      excellent margins and a\n  product that’s easy to sell, you are well on your
      way to creating a powerful business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are serious
      about selling your business in the next two\n  or three years, go to a business
      broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money\n  for a business assessment;
      it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what\n  someone will pay
      for it. The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people\n  pay too
      much for businesses, and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment\n
      \ says their business is worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend spending\n
      \ five or ten thousand dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business. However,\n
      \ it’s a good exercise to go to a business broker and talk to someone who buys
      and\n  sells businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable your business
      is. They\n  may have some tips to get your business more saleable and get a
      fair market assessment\n  on the value of your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the\n  Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively
      on the techniques needed to\n  become a CEO Emeritus. Once you have achieved

      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is

      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t

      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your

      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The CEO Emeritus
      never needs to sell\n  his/her business. The CEO Emeritus creates a business
      that runs very well without\n  their direct daily input. The CEO Emeritus works
      the hours that she wants to work,\n  gets paid a terrific salary (what you earn
      right now or maybe more), does work that\n  she wants to do, and performs activities
      only an owner can; like being the head\n  cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist,
      the keeper of key customer relationships,\n  and the standard bearer. We call
      the CEO Emeritus Activities &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot;\n  Our Business Model Secrets
      Advanced Course covers The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n  instance,
      the Standard Bearer is the person that maintains the level of how well\n  the
      organization performs all work. Have you ever noticed your business runs better\n
      \ when you are in the building versus when you are not? That’s the Standard
      Bearer\n  dynamic at work. It’s not that you are doing anything; it’s just running
      better\n  because you are present. Your people know the standard is higher when
      you are in\n  the building. Bearing the standard is an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All
      of The 16 Hats\n  activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds or thousands of
      dollars per hour, and\n  they don’t take much time. The reason is that the true
      value of the CEO is these\n  infrequent, high-value activities which only the
      CEO can perform. The CEO Emeritus\n  that does a few high-value, low-frequency
      activities and can draw a terrific amount\n  of money out of the business without
      investing tremendous amounts of time. I encourage\n  you to consider the option
      of becoming the CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business.\n  For most business
      owners, it is more financially viable to become a CEO Emeritus\n  than it is
      to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is your business truly\n
      \ saleable for top dollar? Many small businesses sell for three to five times
      their\n  earnings. If you are in one of these businesses it makes a lot more
      sense to create\n  a CEO Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity
      rather than cashing\n  out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates
      a question: In order to create\n  an exit strategy, is your business better
      situated for you to sell it or for you\n  to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      CEO has some work to do to maximize\n  the value of their business. Whether
      you are working to maximize the value of the\n  business for sale to an outside
      party, or working to maximize the value of the income\n  stream for yourself,
      many of the activities overlap. However, if you create a business\n  you can
      run as a CEO Emeritus, you will have created a far more saleable business\n
      \ that will command a much higher price-to-earnings multiple. Therefore, I recommend\n
      \ working towards CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside. If you sell your
      business,\n  it will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus. If you decide
      not to sell,\n  you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      systems or processes\n  are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming
      CEO Emeritus? The simplest\n  way to find out is to physically remove yourself
      from the business premises and\n  figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t
      there. These issues are the first systems\n  that need to be tightened up. Do
      you have the proper people in place for you to\n  assume the role of CEO Emeritus,
      or do you have some holes on your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  issue is never as
      simple as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s almost always a system\n  issue instead.
      Systems are much easier to control than people, so I encourage you\n  to start
      with the systems instead of the people. I think you will find your people\n
      \ will get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times
      we are\n  missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the
      CEO Emeritus role.\n  What role would this person fill? How much will you need
      to pay them? Is your need\n  for control holding you back from assuming the
      CEO Emeritus role? Is your need to\n  be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building a great\n  business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What\n  does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million look like? How much\n  money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO do every day, week,\n
      \ and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What are the differences\n
      \ between that business and yours? Write down five things that need to happen
      in order\n  for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get to work
      on one or two\n  of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make
      your business’ worth\n  to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million check, so keep it up.\n  Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not only build a great business,\n  but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have an outstanding, proprietary\n  business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n
      \ do you need to do to tweak your business model so your business is worth $20
      million?\n  Focus on number one and number two of the &quot;A&quot; categories
      (excellent margins\n  and easy to sell) of Business Model Secrets. If you have
      excellent margins and a\n  product that’s easy to sell, you are well on your
      way to creating a powerful business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are serious
      about selling your business in the next two\n  or three years, go to a business
      broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money\n  for a business assessment;
      it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what\n  someone will pay
      for it. The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people\n  pay too
      much for businesses, and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment\n
      \ says their business is worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend spending\n
      \ five or ten thousand dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business. However,\n
      \ it’s a good exercise to go to a business broker and talk to someone who buys
      and\n  sells businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable your business
      is. They\n  may have some tips to get your business more saleable and get a
      fair market assessment\n  on the value of your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the\n  Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively

      industry may not be around for a long\n  time. I am not advocating changing
      the business you are in. Once you are in a certain\n  business, you are stuck,
      right? That is partially true, but not entirely. For example,\n  think about
      IBM. How do you define their business? If you define their business\n  as a
      provider of equipment and automation for office workers, their business hasn’t\n
      \ changed much over the years. But when you remember that IBM started in office
      machines,\n  then typewriters, then computers, and then service delivery, they
      have done an excellent\n  job of morphing their business model over the years.
      They were constantly shifting\n  into industries and sub-businesses that were
      growing.</p>\\r\\n<p>All businesses can\n  do this if they are open to change.
      It begins with subtly changing the SIC code\n  of the industry you are in. In
      the 1850s people traveled cross country via railroad.\n  Railroads were the
      people movers. Then in the 1920s and 1930s the airline industry\n  was beginning
      and the railroads saw themselves as a railroad and not a people mover.\n  The
      railroads were flush with lots of cash but did nothing to expand into the airline\n
      \ industry because in their minds, they were a railroad. If the railroads had
      seen\n  themselves as a people-moving business, they would have jumped into
      the airline\n  business, or perhaps even the automotive industry.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since
      you scored below\n  average, there are some concerns as to the long-term viability
      of your industry.\n  Ask yourself, &quot;Are you really an IT services company
      or do you help companies\n  improve their business process through the use of
      technology?&quot; Do you see yourself\n  as a gadget seller or do you solve
      a broader customer issue? The issue never changes,\n  just what you sell the
      customer. There’s a bigger picture for everything you do.\n  You are always
      solving a problem for your customers. What you currently do is specifically\n
      \ how you solve their problem. However, these specifics can change over time.
      Your\n  opportunities lie in expanding your products or services in this strong
      industry.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Picture it is ten
      years from now and you are looking into\n  your crystal ball. What does the
      longevity of your business look like in ten years?\n  What is the future environment
      like? Is it better than today, or is it worse? How\n  about twenty years from
      now? Do you still see growth and opportunity in your business?\n  If so, you
      are in great shape. If you have some doubts, analyze things from the\n  worst-case
      perspective. What happens if things play out closer to the worst-case\n  scenario
      rather than your expected or hopeful scenario? Can you mitigate or eliminate\n
      \ this risk?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you avoid the mistake the railroads made? Are
      you in\n  the railroad business or are you in the people moving business? What’s
      the broadest\n  definition of what you do? Make it more specific than &quot;we
      help people.&quot;\n  Exactly how do you help your customers? What businesses
      similar or related to yours\n  help their customers and how do they do it? Are
      there underserved niches in any\n  of these areas? What additional businesses,
      industries or niches can you move into\n  that will help your customers with
      a similar problem?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>I\n  have the perfect
      crystal ball and I inform you that in five years your industry\n  will be in
      very bad shape. You now know you’re heading towards a brick wall. The\n  wall
      is far away, but a brick wall is a brick wall. What can you do today to move\n
      \ away from the brick wall so you have an even better business five years from
      now?\n  This may not appear relevant, but do the exercise anyway. You need to
      constantly\n  experiment, and engage in small, quick trials that can become
      the next big winners\n  in your business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now my crystal ball says
      the general condition of your\n  industry is outstanding five years from now.
      If you knew this fact with 100% certainty,\n  how would you run your business
      differently? What investments would you make to\n  capitalize?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we teach how
      to &quot;Shift the Bell Curve.&quot; This technique can dramatically\n  extend
      the longevity of a product or service. Another powerful technique is &quot;versioning&quot;\n
      \ your business model. Most CEOs are not prepared to throw out their existing
      business\n  model, and they shouldn’t. However, by using the versioning technique,
      you can adapt\n  and improve your model to increase profits and longevity.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      \ owners have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their working
      lives\n  are spent in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs to be
      a significant\n  asset for you and your family. I believe every business owner

      business owners think their\n  businesses are worth more than they actually
      are. Here is an exercise I suggest\n  you do.</p>\\r\\n<p>Imagine I work for
      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50\n  million to buy businesses.
      You and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business\n  right now. I’m going
      to pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business\n  for, $5
      million, $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank.\n
      \ You have a party; you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074470197223.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Business Model
      Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" style=\\\"float: right; margin-left:
      10px;\\\" />The\n  CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO
      Emeritus creates a business\n  that runs very well without their direct daily
      input. The CEO Emeritus works the\n  hours that she wants to work, gets paid
      a terrific salary (what you earn right now\n  or maybe more), does work that
      she wants to do, and performs activities only an\n  owner can; like being the
      head cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist, the keeper\n  of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus\n  Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers\n
      \ The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the Standard Bearer
      is the\n  person that maintains the level of how well the organization performs
      all work.\n  Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are in
      the building versus\n  when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic
      at work. It’s not that you\n  are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present. Your people\n  know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the standard is\n  an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds\n  or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that\n  the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only\n  the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No

      do you need to do to tweak your business\n  model so your business is worth
      $20 million? Focus on number one and number two\n  of the &quot;A&quot; categories
      (excellent margins and easy to sell) of Business\n  Model Secrets. If you have

      on the techniques needed to become a CEO Emeritus.\n  Once you have achieved
      Emeritus status, you might not want to sell your business.\n  In our opinion,
      CEO Emeritus is the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge\n  with clients
      is getting them to believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week\n  and
      make more than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be
      used\n  for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror
      stories\n  about someone who bought a business and it went badly. Bad purchases
      done poorly\n  go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will discuss
      criteria for a\n  good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next

      and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business right now. I’m going to\n

      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t

      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      10px;\\\" />The\n  CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO
      Emeritus creates a business\n  that runs very well without their direct daily
      input. The CEO Emeritus works the\n  hours that she wants to work, gets paid
      a terrific salary (what you earn right now\n  or maybe more), does work that
      she wants to do, and performs activities only an\n  owner can; like being the
      head cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist, the keeper\n  of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus\n  Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers\n
      \ The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the Standard Bearer
      is the\n  person that maintains the level of how well the organization performs
      all work.\n  Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are in
      the building versus\n  when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic
      at work. It’s not that you\n  are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present. Your people\n  know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the standard is\n  an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds\n  or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that\n  the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only\n  the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million\n  check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      do you need to do to tweak your business\n  model so your business is worth

      spending five or ten thousand\n  dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business.
      However, it’s a good exercise\n  to go to a business broker and talk to someone
      who buys and sells businesses all\n  day. Let them tell you how saleable your
      business is. They may have some tips to\n  get your business more saleable and

      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we focus extensively
      on the techniques needed to become a CEO Emeritus.\n  Once you have achieved
      Emeritus status, you might not want to sell your business.\n  In our opinion,
      CEO Emeritus is the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge\n  with clients
      is getting them to believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week\n  and
      make more than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be
      used\n  for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror
      stories\n  about someone who bought a business and it went badly. Bad purchases
      done poorly\n  go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will discuss
      criteria for a\n  good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next

      ! \"<h4>You scored below average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Most business\n
      \ owners have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their working
      lives\n  are spent in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs to be
      a significant\n  asset for you and your family. I believe every business owner
      should be able to\n  sell their business for a financially meaningful sum.  That
      sum is to be defined\n  by you. It needs to be enough so you will never need
      to work again if you do not\n  want to. Let’s say the amount is $50 million.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      you put your business\n  up for sale today, could you sell it for that? Most
      business owners think their\n  businesses are worth more than they actually
      are. Here is an exercise I suggest\n  you do.</p>\\r\\n<p>Imagine I work for
      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50\n  million to buy businesses.
      You and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business\n  right now. I’m going
      to pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business\n  for, $5
      million, $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank.\n
      \ You have a party; you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      10px;\\\" />The\n  CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO
      Emeritus creates a business\n  that runs very well without their direct daily
      input. The CEO Emeritus works the\n  hours that she wants to work, gets paid
      a terrific salary (what you earn right now\n  or maybe more), does work that
      she wants to do, and performs activities only an\n  owner can; like being the
      head cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist, the keeper\n  of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus\n  Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers\n
      \ The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the Standard Bearer
      is the\n  person that maintains the level of how well the organization performs
      all work.\n  Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are in
      the building versus\n  when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic
      at work. It’s not that you\n  are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present. Your people\n  know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the standard is\n  an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds\n  or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that\n  the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only\n  the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1325884218698187.jpg\\\"\n

      />Will your business\n  model enable you make your business’ worth to $20 million?
      You may be well on your\n  way to a $20 million check, so keep it up. Working
      toward becoming a CEO Emeritus\n  is a safe way to not only build a great business,
      but a valuable one as well. You\n  will also need to have an outstanding, proprietary
      business model. No one is going\n  to write a $20 million check for a me-too
      business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What do you need to\n  do to tweak your business model
      so your business is worth $20 million? Focus on\n  number one and number two
      of the &quot;A&quot; categories (excellent margins and\n  easy to sell) of Business
      Model Secrets. If you have excellent margins and a product\n  that’s easy to
      sell, you are well on your way to creating a powerful business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If\n
      \ you are serious about selling your business in the next two or three years,
      go to\n  a business broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money for a business
      assessment;\n  it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what someone
      will pay for it.\n  The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people
      pay too much for businesses,\n  and I have seen people get very upset when an

      more saleable and get a fair market assessment on the value of\n  your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we focus extensively
      on the techniques needed to become a CEO Emeritus.\n  Once you have achieved
      Emeritus status, you might not want to sell your business.\n  In our opinion,
      CEO Emeritus is the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge\n  with clients
      is getting them to believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week\n  and
      make more than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be
      used\n  for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror
      stories\n  about someone who bought a business and it went badly. Bad purchases
      done poorly\n  go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will discuss
      criteria for a\n  good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next
      level.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:51:20.455178000Z\nupdated_at: 2012-01-06

      ! \"<h4>You scored well on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Most business owners have\n
      \ their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their working lives are
      spent\n  in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs to be a significant
      asset for\n  you and your family. I believe every business owner should be able
      to sell their\n  business for a financially meaningful sum. That sum is to be
      defined by you. It\n  needs to be enough so you will never need to work again
      if you do not want to. Let’s\n  say the amount is $50 million.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      you put your business up for sale today,\n  could you sell it for that? Most
      business owners think their businesses are worth\n  more than they actually
      are. Here is an exercise I suggest you do.</p>\\r\\nI<p>magine\n  I work for
      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50 million to buy businesses.\n  You
      and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business right now. I’m going to\n
      \ pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business for, $5 million,\n
      \ $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank. You have
      a party;\n  you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074470197223.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Business Model
      Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" style=\\\"float: right; margin-left:
      10px;\\\" />The\n  CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO
      Emeritus creates a business\n  that runs very well without their direct daily
      input. The CEO Emeritus works the\n  hours that she wants to work, gets paid
      a terrific salary (what you earn right now\n  or maybe more), does work that
      she wants to do, and performs activities only an\n  owner can; like being the
      head cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist, the keeper\n  of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus\n  Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers\n
      \ The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the Standard Bearer
      is the\n  person that maintains the level of how well the organization performs
      all work.\n  Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are in
      the building versus\n  when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic
      at work. It’s not that you\n  are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present. Your people\n  know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the standard is\n  an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds\n  or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that\n  the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only\n  the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million\n  check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      style=\\\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\\\" />What do you need\n  to do to
      tweak your business model so your business is worth $20 million? Focus\n  on
      number one and number two of the &quot;A&quot; categories (excellent margins\n
      \ and easy to sell) of Business Model Secrets. If you have excellent margins
      and a\n  product that’s easy to sell, you are well on your way to creating a
      powerful business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are serious about selling your
      business in the next two\n  or three years, visit a business broker. I don’t
      recommend you pay a lot of money\n  for a business assessment; it’s completely
      subjective. Your business is worth what\n  someone will pay for it. The valuation
      is just a number on paper. I have seen people\n  pay too much for businesses,
      and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment\n  says their business
      is worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend spending\n  five or ten
      thousand dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business. However,\n  it’s
      a good exercise to go to a business broker and talk to someone who buys and\n
      \ sells businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable your business is.
      They\n  may have some tips to get your business more saleable and get a fair
      market assessment\n  on the value of your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In

      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If

      the problem and the quality\n  of the sales staff is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the\n  salability of the product combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent.\n  Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on building\n  a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"

      can do a better job ignoring your own opinions and biases regarding\n  &quot;what
      the customer wants, needs and desires.&quot; Instead, listen to the market.\n
      \ You should pay attention to market data, not your own subjective opinions.
      Listening\n  to the market instead of listening to you is a great tactic to
      use to create an\n  easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to
      be sold. However, some products\n  need more selling and others need more marketing
      in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n  the sale. For instance, insurance tends to
      be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n  tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      easiest way to determine whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed
      is to do an exercise I call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example:
      if you could only sell your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would
      happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling
      marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However,
      you have the best sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars.
      What happens to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or
      slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n
      \ not even bad-sales-people selling. However, the best marketing team in the
      world\n  works with your product. You get all those promotional items that you
      currently\n  don’t have: marketing geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific
      marketing technique\n  you can think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales
      go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n  truth, marketing brings prospects
      to your door. When marketing brings people to\n  you they are sometimes fully
      sold, and sometimes only partially sold. For most businesses,\n  marketing partially
      sells prospects and the sales force needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this
      question can be very challenging. However, it will let you know which is more\n
      \ important for your product or service, marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times\n  I see business owners who put too much emphasis on selling, when the
      prerequisite\n  to the sale is really the marketing. In this case, marketing
      needs to be effective\n  in order to make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      second component of easy\n  to sell is filling an unserved or underserved market.
      It’s as simple as comparing\n  the demand for the product or service to how
      many vendors are chasing market share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an
      unserved or underserved market. In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a
      &quot;me too&quot; product, even if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself:
      How would your customers feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your
      customers would experience a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n
      \ your answer is closer to, &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time
      finding\n  another HVAC contractor in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work
      and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product or service
      should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Many times we see an
      outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and perform their &quot;black
      magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just seem to do it. Perhaps
      we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great sales people who move from
      company to company and continue to sell well do\n  so because they are great
      at understanding how to sell products. This does not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit
      presentations. The secret of great sales people is\n  they are great at creating
      a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally,
      without knowing how they do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps,
      perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable
      and repeatable sales process. The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product
      that is easy to sell, is to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales
      process. Since you scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n
      \ repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n
      \ sales process is, can an ideal prospect be identified and defined? If you
      don’t\n  know where to find the people who buy your products, you will not have
      an easy time\n  selling them. Can you simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages,
      or are you trying to\n  search for a needle in a haystack?  Since you scored
      well on this, you probably\n  know the profile of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      old saying in business, &quot;Find a parade and get in front of it.&quot;\n
      \ Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot; product are in front of the
      parade,\n  not behind it. Most products and services only have a 20-year life
      span. You want\n  to be out in front of the growth curve, not chasing it. Nothing
      is worse than being\n  a late entry into a market which is maturing. When this
      happens, prices drop, competition\n  increases, and the market declines. These
      are the markets you not only want to avoid\n  getting into, but want to get
      out of. You always need to be aware of where you are\n  in the product development
      and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you analyzing true, unfiltered

      marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you created a definable and repeatable

      customers you sell to, and the product or service mix you offer, so\n  you can
      get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is your parade coming to an end\n
      \ in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n
      \ you looked at your existing prospect list and performed an in-depth analysis
      to\n  determine how you find, generate interest from, and sell prospects? Have
      you gone\n  through your prospect list to see if you can create a process for
      finding more of\n  them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p><img

      style=\\\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 300px;\\\" />Look\n  into
      your crystal ball three, four, or five years into the future. Don’t look at\n
      \ what the future of your company holds, but at the future of your industry,
      and the\n  general environment your company will be operating in. What does
      this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the general economy look
      like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      do the customers you sell\n  to look like? Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      technology\n  trends exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your
      predictions of the\n  future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how
      you get in front of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like
      this in the Business Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or
      twenty customers. How did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate
      interest from them during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be
      very pragmatic when analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe
      what you want to believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of
      view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down with your best salespeople and/or your best former\n
      \ salespeople and pick their brains. Get insight into the processes they used.
      They’ll\n  be inclined to tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just
      went in and sold\n  stuff.&quot; This is not true. They used a process. Ask
      them to describe, in detail,\n  the last five big sales they had, step by step,
      play by play, inch by inch, and\n  search for the commonalities. There will
      be plenty of them. Now take that information\n  and create a company-wide, repeatable
      sales process so you can elevate the performance\n  of your average, and not
      so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved\n  or underserved
      markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace and get\n  ahead

      are doing a pretty good job ignoring\n  your own opinions and biases regarding
      &quot;what the customer wants, needs and\n  desires.&quot; Instead, you are
      listening to the market. Great job! You need to\n  pay attention to market data,
      not your own subjective opinions. Listening to the\n  market instead of listening
      to yourself is a great tactic to use to create an easy-to-sell\n  product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product needs to be sold. However, some products need more\n  selling and others
      need more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale.\n  For instance,
      insurance tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to\n  be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The easiest way to determine whether your\n  product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;\n
      \ Here is an example: if you could only sell your product and were allowed NO
      marketing,\n  what would happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling\n  marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you\n  have the best sales force in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What\n  happens to your sales? Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now\n  flip over the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people\n  selling.
      However, the best marketing team in the world works with your product.\n  You
      get all those promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,\n
      \ Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented.\n  What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing\n  brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes\n  fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially\n  sells prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question\n  can be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for\n  your product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business\n  owners who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is\n  really
      the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to\n  make
      the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is\n  filling an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand\n  for the product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product\n  is easier to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours\n  ends up being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself: How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your customers would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n  your answer is closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding\n  another HVAC contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product or service should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process.
      Many times we see an outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and
      perform their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just
      seem to do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great
      sales people who move from company to company and continue to sell well do\n
      \ so because they are great at understanding how to sell products. This does
      not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great
      sales people is\n  they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally, without knowing how they
      do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones,
      but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable and repeatable sales process.
      The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product that is easy to sell, is
      to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales process. Since you
      scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n  repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n  sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined? If you don’t\n  know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have an easy time\n  selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are you trying to\n  search for a needle
      in a haystack? Since you scored well on this, you probably know\n  the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499820982468.jpg\\\"\n

      \ is an old saying in business, &quot;Find a parade and get in front of it.&quot;\n
      \ Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot; product are in front of the
      parade,\n  not behind it. Most products and services only have a 20-year life
      span. You want\n  to be out in front of the growth curve, not chasing it. Nothing
      is worse than being\n  a late entry into a market which is maturing. When this
      happens, prices drop, competition\n  increases, and the market declines. These
      are the markets you not only want to avoid\n  getting into, but want to get
      out of. You always need to be aware of where you are\n  in the product development
      and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you analyzing true, unfiltered

      customers you sell to, and the product or service mix you offer, so\n  you can
      get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is your parade coming to an end\n
      \ in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n
      \ you looked at your existing prospect list and performed an in-depth analysis
      to\n  determine how you find, generate interest from, and sell prospects? Have

      and the\n  general environment your company will be operating in. What does
      this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the general economy look
      like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What

      predictions of the\n  future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how
      you get in front of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like
      this in the Business Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or
      twenty customers. How did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate
      interest from them during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be
      very pragmatic when analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe
      what you want to believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of
      view.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sit down with your best salespeople and/or your best former\n
      \ salespeople and pick their brains. Get insight into the processes they used.
      They’ll\n  be inclined to tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just
      went in and sold\n  stuff.&quot; This is not true. They used a process. Ask
      them to describe, in detail,\n  the last five big sales they had, step by step,
      play by play, inch by inch, and\n  search for the commonalities. There will
      be plenty of them. Now take that information\n  and create a company-wide, repeatable
      sales process so you can elevate the performance\n  of your average, and not
      so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved\n  or underserved
      markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace and get\n  ahead

      play by play, inch by inch, and\n  search for the commonalities. There will
      be plenty of them. Now take that information\n  and create a company-wide, repeatable
      sales process so you can elevate the performance\n  of your average, and not
      so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved\n  or underserved
      markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace and get\n  ahead
      of the competition. If you can, create new products and services that will\n
      \ be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n
      \ business owners learn from the masters. They know how to take a 100-year-old
      idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There are two powerful ideas you can
      borrow from\n  Thomas Edison and King Gillette to create a product that is easier
      to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas\n  Edison had to install electric lights for free
      in a New York high rise because he\n  couldn’t get anyone to try them. Similarly,
      Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy\n  his safety razors. It’s hard to imagine
      such superior products were not accepted\n  by the marketplace, but it happens
      all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat consumer\n  apathy, he created a
      massive network of partners to give away his razors (the whole\n  unit with
      handle and blades) for free. Once consumers used the product, they saw\n  the
      value and came back for the high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy\n
      \ today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other companies like Jell-O and Ford have used similar
      models.\n  In fact, Henry Ford was quoted as saying, &quot;I will give you the
      car if you just\n  buy the replacement parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a
      powerful business model can\n  create an easier to sell product and reduce reliance
      on an expensive sales force\n  in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17

      \ margin-right: 10px;\\\" />I live in the Midwest where there are many ethanol
      refineries.\n  They came into existence at a cost of hundreds of millions of
      dollars each. Then,\n  the price of oil dropped dramatically and this industry
      became nonviable without\n  additional government subsidies. These subsidies
      never did occur and many of these\n  ethanol plants are being shut down before
      ever coming online. The longevity of the\n  industry was not sustainable without
      the high price of oil.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your industry\n  may not be around for a
      long time. I am not advocating changing the business you\n  are in. Once you
      are in a certain business, you are stuck, right? That is partially\n  true,
      but not entirely. For example, think about IBM. How do you define their business?\n
      \ If you define their business as a provider of equipment and automation for
      office\n  workers, their business hasn’t changed much over the years. But when
      you remember\n  that IBM started in office machines, then typewriters, then
      computers, and then\n  service delivery, they have done an excellent job of
      morphing their business model\n  over the years. They were constantly shifting
      into industries and sub-businesses\n  that were growing.</p>\\r\\n<p>All businesses
      can do this if they are open to change.\n  It begins with subtly changing the
      SIC code of the industry you are in. In the 1850s\n  people traveled cross country
      via railroad. Railroads were the people movers. Then\n  in the 1920s and 1930s
      the airline industry was beginning and the railroads saw\n  themselves as a
      railroad and not a people mover. The railroads were flush with lots\n  of cash
      but did nothing to expand into the airline industry because in their minds,\n
      \ they were a railroad. If the railroads had seen themselves as a people-moving
      business,\n  they would have jumped into the airline business, or perhaps even
      the automotive\n  industry.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below average, there
      are some concerns as to\n  the long-term viability of your industry. Ask yourself,
      &quot;Are you really an\n  IT services company or do you help companies improve
      their business process through\n  the use of technology?&quot; Do you see yourself
      as a gadget seller or do you solve\n  a broader customer issue? The issue never
      changes, just what you sell the customer.\n  There’s a bigger picture for everything
      you do. You are always solving a problem\n  for your customers. What you currently
      do is specifically how you solve their problem.\n  However, these specifics
      can change over time. Your opportunities lie in expanding\n  your products or
      services in this strong industry.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      from now and you are looking\n  into your crystal ball. What does the longevity
      of your business look like in ten\n  years? What is the future environment like?
      Is it better than today, or is it worse?\n  How about twenty years from now?
      Do you still see growth and opportunity in your\n  business? If so, you are
      in great shape. If you have some doubts, analyze things\n  from the worst-case
      perspective. What happens if things play out closer to the worst-case\n  scenario
      rather than your expected or hopeful scenario? Can you mitigate or eliminate\n
      \ this risk?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you avoid the mistake the railroads made? Are
      you in\n  the railroad business or are you in the people moving business? What’s
      the broadest\n  definition of what you do? Make it more specific than &quot;we
      help people.&quot;\n  Exactly how do you help your customers? What businesses
      similar or related to yours\n  help their customers and how do they do it? Are
      there underserved niches in any\n  of these areas? What additional businesses,
      industries or niches can you move into\n  that will help your customers with
      a similar problem?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>I\n  have the perfect
      crystal ball and I inform you that in five years your industry\n  will be in
      very bad shape. You now know you’re heading towards a brick wall. The\n  wall
      is far away, but a brick wall is a brick wall. What can you do today to move\n
      \ away from the brick wall so you have an even better business five years from
      now?\n  This may not appear relevant, but do the exercise anyway. You need to
      constantly\n  experiment, and engage in small, quick trials that can become
      the next big winners\n  in your business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now my crystal ball says
      the general condition of your\n  industry is outstanding five years from now.
      If you knew this fact with 100% certainty,\n  how would you run your business
      differently? What investments would you make to\n  capitalize?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we teach how
      to &quot;Shift the Bell Curve.&quot; This technique can dramatically\n  extend
      the longevity of a product or service. Another powerful technique is &quot;versioning&quot;\n
      \ your business model. Most CEOs are not prepared to throw out their existing
      business\n  model, and they shouldn’t. However, by using the versioning technique,
      you can adapt\n  and improve your model to increase profits and longevity.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your

      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      10px;\\\" />The\n  CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO
      Emeritus creates a business\n  that runs very well without their direct daily
      input. The CEO Emeritus works the\n  hours that she wants to work, gets paid
      a terrific salary (what you earn right now\n  or maybe more), does work that
      she wants to do, and performs activities only an\n  owner can; like being the
      head cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist, the keeper\n  of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus\n  Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers\n
      \ The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the Standard Bearer
      is the\n  person that maintains the level of how well the organization performs
      all work.\n  Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are in
      the building versus\n  when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic
      at work. It’s not that you\n  are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present. Your people\n  know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the standard is\n  an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds\n  or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that\n  the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only\n  the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1325884218532087.png\\\"\n

      />Will your business\n  model enable you make your business’ worth to $20 million?
      You may be well on your\n  way to a $20 million check, so keep it up. Working
      toward becoming a CEO Emeritus\n  is a safe way to not only build a great business,
      but a valuable one as well. You\n  will also need to have an outstanding, proprietary
      business model. No one is going\n  to write a $20 million check for a me-too
      business.</p>\\r\\n<p>What do you need to\n  do to tweak your business model
      so your business is worth $20 million? Focus on\n  number one and number two
      of the &quot;A&quot; categories (excellent margins and\n  easy to sell) of Business
      Model Secrets. If you have excellent margins and a product\n  that’s easy to
      sell, you are well on your way to creating a powerful business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If\n
      \ you are serious about selling your business in the next two or three years,
      go to\n  a business broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money for a business
      assessment;\n  it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what someone
      will pay for it.\n  The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people
      pay too much for businesses,\n  and I have seen people get very upset when an
      assessment says their business is\n  worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t
      recommend spending five or ten thousand\n  dollars to get a formal appraisal
      of your business. However, it’s a good exercise\n  to go to a business broker
      and talk to someone who buys and sells businesses all\n  day. Let them tell
      you how saleable your business is. They may have some tips to\n  get your business
      more saleable and get a fair market assessment on the value of\n  your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets\n  program, we focus extensively
      on the techniques needed to become a CEO Emeritus.\n  Once you have achieved
      Emeritus status, you might not want to sell your business.\n  In our opinion,
      CEO Emeritus is the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge\n  with clients
      is getting them to believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week\n  and
      make more than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be
      used\n  for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror
      stories\n  about someone who bought a business and it went badly. Bad purchases
      done poorly\n  go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will discuss
      criteria for a\n  good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next
      level.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:51:20.449363000Z\nupdated_at: 2012-01-06

      you scored well,\n  every business has the ability to make meaningful changes
      to improve the quality\n  of their business model. Remembering that business
      models erode over time, the included\n  report contains insights and tips that
      you may not have considered and that may\n  help to maintain or even improve
      your score.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\\r\\n<p>&quot;A\n  business model
      is the proprietary methodology used to acquire, service, and retain\n  customers.&quot;
      &mdash; Jim Muehlhausen, Author &quot;The 51 Fatal Business Errors\n  and How
      to Avoid Them&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your business model is your secret sauce.\n
      \ Your model is what makes your business unique. Your business model is the
      formula\n  you use to outsmart your competitors, provide ongoing value to customers,
      and continually\n  grow your business. There are eight essential areas to a
      business model:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n  have excellent margins</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      be easy to sell</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must have\n  The Four Capitals&copy;: Intellectual
      Capital, Financial Capital, Human Capital\n  and Brand Capital</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      be able to maintain ongoing competitive advantage</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n  have
      quality customers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must have longevity of the industry</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n
      \ provide for the owner’s graceful exit</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must avoid pitfalls</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Not\n
      \ all the areas carry an equal weight. As you can see from the graph of the
      section\n  weighs below, the combination of excellent margins plus an easy to
      sell product\n  account for over one half of the total score. Significant research
      has gone into\n  this scoring process to assess your business model with the
      greatest accuracy. Remember\n  that your competitors are actively working to
      improve there competitive position\n  and therefore business models erode over
      time. No matter what your score, your best\n  source of competitive advantage
      is to be continually actively working to refine\n  and improve your business
      model.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1323378575149393.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"The Ideal Business Model\\\" title=\\\"The Ideal Business Model\\\"
      /></p>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the past, you may not have given much thought to your business
      model. Most business\n  books teach us that our business plan is the most important
      tool for managing our\n  business success. However, a stellar business plan
      is not much good without a solid\n  business model behind it.</p>\\r\\n<div
      style=\\\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\n  text-align: center;\\\">Great
      business plan + bad business model = a bad business</div>\\r\\n<div\n  style=\\\"font-weight:
      bold; font-style: italic; text-align: center;\\\">Average business\n  plan +
      great business model = a great business</div>\\r\\n<p>Previously, there were\n
      \ no objective criteria for gauging the quality of a business model. Venture
      capitalists\n  and bankers had been judging business models for years, but on
      subjective, gut impressions.\n  Our model uses a scientific, objective approach
      to grading an existing business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are still not sold
      on the importance of your business model,\n  ponder this: all business models
      will go stale if unaltered. Typically, this process\n  takes ten to twenty years.
      Here are some examples:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockbuster\n  video made
      hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in the 1990’s and commanded\n  a
      90% market share. Today it is nearly defunct.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IBM has successfully\n
      \ morphed its business model several times over the years in order to remain
      successful\n  vs. Xerox and Kodak who have not.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Radio stations
      were a profitable\n  cash cow for decades until iPods came along.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If
      you were Wal-Mart\n  in the 1990s, would you have figured that your biggest
      competitor would be Amazon.com?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>For\n  many retailers, the
      tried and true Yellow Pages method of customer attraction has\n  stopped working.
      Successful retailers have changed their client attraction model\n  to continue
      their success.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>This Business Model Evaluator Report\n
      \ below has several specific suggestions how to innovate biz model. Work with
      your\n  consulting partner to implement these solutions and watch your business
      grow.</p>\"\nid: 1\n"

      \ is to create dramatically improve your margins. There is no such thing as
      a great\n  company that does not have great margins. The two go together. You
      need to begin\n  to innovate and refine your business model to grow your margins.
      You may have bad\n  competitors crowding the marketplace and eroding your margin.
      Can you differentiate\n  your product to command higher margins? What additional
      value or features can you\n  add to the offering to allow you to charge more?
      Are there dramatic cost saving\n  opportunities? Remember, no margin, no mission.</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      may need to start\n  fresh. You will continue to struggle if you do not raise
      margins. It may be difficult\n  or impossible to modify your existing offerings
      to dramatically raise margins. If\n  this is the case, you may be better off
      to add a new offering rather than modify\n  a flawed one. Many great companies
      were born as small trial divisions of failed\n  companies. Toys'R'Us us was
      a small division of a failed retailer. CarMax was a\n  division of Circuit City.
      Consider introducing a high-margin product or service\n  that could turn into
      a significant portion of your revenue.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472286719.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>What steps, philosophies and business practices have
      you\n  used to create your best margin products and services? Don’t get caught
      up in the\n  specifics of how you did it, stick to the philosophies that got
      you there. Over\n  time, all business models erode, as will yours. It will not
      be in minutes, weeks\n  or months. It will be over the course of years or decades.
      However, all business\n  models do erode over time. You need to continue to
      innovate your business model,\n  your products, and your services to allow for
      higher margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>What new\n  products or services can you add to
      your offerings to make margins even higher?\n  What products or services can
      you withdraw from your offerings to increase the overall\n  margin of the company?</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times these marginal products and services\n  drain company resources and don’t
      add to the bottom line significantly. Many times\n  companies can run better
      and more profitably simply by reducing products or service\n  offerings, or
      even firing customers.</p>\\r\\n<p>By firing customers, the objective\n  is
      to not only get away from customers who are a pain, but to get away from customers\n
      \ who are draining organizational resources. These customers do not provide
      profit\n  commensurate with the resources they consume.</p>\\r\\n<p>Do you have
      the luxury of\n  ignoring bad competition or all competition? You most likely
      cannot. There’s an\n  old saying in business, the fastest way out of business
      is imitating your competitors.\n  We don’t want to always be looking in the
      rear view mirror at our competitors. Have\n  we been doing this? How much of
      our margin issue is due to bad or excessive competition?\n  How can we differentiate
      ourselves to gently exit this over-competitive market?\n  We are far better
      off to be in a smaller segment wit excellent margins than to be\n  in the “shark-tank”
      fighting for the big part of the market.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Engage\n
      \ in customer analysis and see if any customer needs to be fired to continue
      to grow\n  our margin. See the example below for a starting point.<br /><img

      It isn’t what you\n  think. We don’t want you to sell life insurance. However,

      in order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n  the sale. For instance, insurance tends to
      be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n  tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      easiest way to determine whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed
      is to do an exercise I call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example:
      if you could only sell your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would
      happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling
      marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However,
      you have the best sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars.
      What happens to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or
      slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n
      \ not even bad-sales-people selling. However, the best marketing team in the
      world\n  works with your product. You get all those promotional items that you
      currently\n  don’t have: marketing geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific
      marketing technique\n  you can think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales
      go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n  truth, marketing brings prospects
      to your door. When marketing brings people to\n  you they are sometimes fully
      sold, and sometimes only partially sold. For most businesses,\n  marketing partially
      sells prospects and the sales force needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this
      question can be very challenging. However, it will let you know which is more\n
      \ important for your product or service, marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times\n  I see business owners who put too much emphasis on selling, when the
      prerequisite\n  to the sale is really the marketing. In this case, marketing
      needs to be effective\n  in order to make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      second component of easy\n  to sell is filling an unserved or underserved market.
      It’s as simple as comparing\n  the demand for the product or service to how
      many vendors are chasing market share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an
      unserved or underserved market. In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a
      &quot;me too&quot; product, even if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself:
      How would your customers feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your
      customers would experience a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n
      \ your answer is closer to, &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time
      finding\n  another HVAC contractor in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work
      and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product or service
      should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Many times we see an
      outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and perform their &quot;black
      magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just seem to do it. Perhaps
      we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great sales people who move from
      company to company and continue to sell well do\n  so because they are great
      at understanding how to sell products. This does not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit
      presentations. The secret of great sales people is\n  they are great at creating
      a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally,
      without knowing how they do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps,
      perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable
      and repeatable sales process. The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product
      that is easy to sell, is to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales
      process. Since you scored well on this, you probably have a definable and\n
      \ repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A subcomponent of a definable and repeatable\n
      \ sales process is, can an ideal prospect be identified and defined? If you
      don’t\n  know where to find the people who buy your products, you will not have
      an easy time\n  selling them. Can you simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages,
      or are you trying to\n  search for a needle in a haystack?  Since you scored
      well on this, you probably\n  know the profile of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      old saying in business, &quot;Find a parade and get in front of it.&quot;\n
      \ Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot; product are in front of the
      parade,\n  not behind it. Most products and services only have a 20-year life
      span. You want\n  to be out in front of the growth curve, not chasing it. Nothing
      is worse than being\n  a late entry into a market which is maturing. When this
      happens, prices drop, competition\n  increases, and the market declines. These
      are the markets you not only want to avoid\n  getting into, but want to get
      out of. You always need to be aware of where you are\n  in the product development
      and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n

      are doing a good job ignoring your own opinions and biases regarding\n  &quot;what
      the customer wants, needs and desires.&quot; Instead, you are listening\n  to
      the market. Great job! You need to pay attention to market data, not your own\n
      \ subjective opinions. Listening to the market instead of listening to you is
      a great\n  tactic to use to create an easy to sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every
      product needs to\n  be sold. However, some products need more selling and others
      need more marketing\n  in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance,
      insurance tends to be sold\n  more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  easiest way to determine whether your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to\n  do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling marketing at all. It all\n  goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you have the best sales force\n  in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What happens to your sales?\n  Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over\n  the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people selling. However,\n
      \ the best marketing team in the world works with your product. You get all
      those\n  promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,
      Web 2.0 strategies,\n  every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented. What happens?\n  Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects\n  to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business owners\n  who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really\n
      \ the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make
      the\n  product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is filling\n  an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is\n  closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC\n  contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times\n  we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black\n  magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem
      to do it. Perhaps we give\n  them more credit than they deserve. Great sales
      people who move from company to\n  company and continue to sell well do so because
      they are great at understanding\n  how to sell products. This does not mean
      they excel at feature/benefit presentations.\n  The secret of great sales people
      is they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  of the truly
      great sales people do it naturally, without knowing how they do it.\n  They
      create a procedure, a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless,\n
      \ which result in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every
      company,\n  if you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create
      a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this,
      you probably have a\n  definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable\n  and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined?\n  If you don’t know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have\n  an easy time selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are\n  you trying to search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this,\n  you probably know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499820982468.jpg\\\"\n

      /></p>\\r\\n<p>There\n  is an old saying in business, &quot;Find a parade and
      get in front of it.&quot;\n  Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;
      product are in front of the parade,\n  not behind it. Most products and services
      only have a 20-year life span. You want\n  to be out in front of the growth
      curve, not chasing it. Nothing is worse than being\n  a late entry into a market
      which is maturing. When this happens, prices drop, competition\n  increases,
      and the market declines. These are the markets you not only want to avoid\n
      \ getting into, but want to get out of. You always need to be aware of where
      you are\n  in the product development and product life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n  you thinking like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      you analyzing true, unfiltered data\n  that is coming to you, or are you interpreting
      data to be what you want or need\n  it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you blaming
      your sales people for marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  solid is your
      definable and repeatable sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Will you continue\n
      \ to be in front of the parade or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If you are in
      danger of\n  getting behind the parade, how can you alter the customers which
      you sell to, and\n  the product or service mix you offer, so you can get in
      front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n  your parade coming to an end in
      the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade\n  to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you looked at your existing prospect list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis
      to determine how you find, generate interest\n  from, and sell prospects? Have
      you gone through your prospect list to see if you\n  can create a process for
      finding more of them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Look\n
      \ into your crystal ball three, four, or five years into the future. Don’t look
      at\n  what the future of your company holds, but at the future of your industry,
      and the\n  general environment your company will be operating in. What does
      this environment\n  look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the general economy look
      like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n  the local and state economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      do the customers you sell\n  to look like? Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      technology\n  trends exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your
      predictions of the\n  future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how
      you get in front of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like
      this in the Business Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or
      twenty customers. How did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate
      interest from them during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be
      very pragmatic when analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe
      what you want to believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of
      view.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324486881300460.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; width:
      300px;\\\" />Sit\n  down with your best salespeople and/or your best former
      salespeople and pick their\n  brains. Get insight into the processes they used.
      They’ll be inclined to tell you,\n  &quot;I don’t know how I did it, I just
      went in and sold stuff.&quot; This is not\n  true. They used a process. Ask
      them to describe, in detail, the last five big sales\n  they had, step by step,
      play by play, inch by inch, and search for the commonalities.\n  There will
      be plenty of them. Now take that information and create a company-wide,\n  repeatable
      sales process so you can elevate the performance of your average, and\n  not
      so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved or underserved\n
      \ markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace and get ahead
      of the\n  competition. If you can, create new products and services that will
      be easy to sell\n  and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Savvy
      business\n  owners learn from the masters. They know how to take a 100-year-old
      idea and modify\n  it for today’s market. There are two powerful ideas you can
      borrow from Thomas Edison\n  and King Gillette to create a product that is easier
      to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas Edison\n  had to install electric lights for free
      in a New York high rise because he couldn’t\n  get anyone to try them. Similarly,
      Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his safety\n  razors. It’s hard to imagine
      such superior products were not accepted by the marketplace,\n  but it happens
      all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat consumer apathy, he created\n  a
      massive network of partners to give away his razors (the whole unit with handle\n
      \ and blades) for free. Once consumers used the product, they saw the value
      and came\n  back for the high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy
      today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other\n  companies like Jell-O and Ford have used similar
      models. In fact, Henry Ford was\n  quoted as saying, &quot;I will give you the
      car if you just buy the replacement\n  parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a
      powerful business model can create an easier\n  to sell product and reduce reliance
      on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:57:23.401542000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored low on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial capital.</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\\\"
      /></p>\\r\\n<p>Bill\n  Gates is quoted as saying, &quot;Without our top 20 people,
      Microsoft would be an\n  insignificant company.&quot; A great business cannot
      run without great people and\n  your business has been successful attracting
      and retaining top talent. You may have\n  struggled competing with big businesses
      regarding this. Have you figured out a strategy\n  to work without &quot;superstars&quot;
      yet still have a well-running business? This\n  is a &quot;must for many small
      businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep in mind that there is\n  an asset, not list on
      your balance sheet, called human capital. This human capital\n  consists of
      the worker’s knowledge base, their abilities, their relationship with\n  customers,
      and their ability to execute your business plan., All these components\n  add
      up to the intangible value of those employees to your business. The more talented\n
      \ and tenured an employee, the more valuable he or she is to your business.
      You have\n  retained your talented staff after spending time, energy and effort
      to teach them\n  the knowledge necessary which to be useful to our business.
      Talent will flow to\n  its highest and best use. Continue to carve out areas
      where talented people’s best\n  &quot;use&quot; is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand
      Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business\n  enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot;
      is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles and\n  the Gillettes of the world. Every business
      has a brand, whether they want one or\n  not. A brand does not need to be overly
      complicated. A brand is what your company\n  &quot;means&quot; to your customers.
      It’s that simple. You want your brand to mean\n  &quot;excellent service and
      great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers on time, every\n  time.&quot; You don’t
      want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much more expensive\n  than I thought,&quot;
      or &quot;they don’t really care about their customers,&quot;\n  or &quot;they
      make a mess every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n
      \ brand DOES mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n
      \ positive in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n
      \ How can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to
      the customer,\n  so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas
      include: Burger\n  King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy
      drink, and Trump steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance,
      Toyota markets inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather
      than adding another model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you
      scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and
      add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the
      principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products
      make up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may
      comprise 80% of the sales. However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n
      \ or winning products make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises
      80%.\n  Most small businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should
      pick a place\n  on the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
      center;\\\"><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"
      alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These
      days, with so much global competition\n  and so many options for every customer,
      there is virtually no industry that does\n  not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition crushes margins. Branding\n  to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is a way to battle this. Can\n  market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot;\n  If there
      was market data on some great new niche, it would be obvious to everyone.\n
      \ The only way to create a powerful niche on the long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not\n  a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey guess. You may
      be blindfolded,\n  but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen for tiny
      clues from your customers,\n  vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs
      are latent; they won’t jump up\n  and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a $3 cup of coffee, or a personal\n  computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the idea, despite any data, and created\n  something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n
      \ you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How is your
      Rolodex\n  under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write down
      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital.During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and profit
      from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-18 00:44:49.399686000Z\nupdated_at:

      areas. We’ll run\n  through them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      high score\n  indicates you may have some valuable intellectual capital. Every
      business sells\n  intellectual property. Intellectual property isn’t just for
      doctors, patent attorneys,\n  accountants and chip designers. Everyone is in
      the idea, or intellectual property,\n  business. If you make widgets, is it
      the generic making of the widgets that generates\n  the profit, probably not?
      More likely, it is your proprietary way of making the\n  widgets, or your secret
      vendors, or the way you train your staff that accounts for\n  the profits. These
      are all examples of intellectual property. The only true asset\n  your business
      has is the ability to generate a profit doing the things you do the\n  way you
      do them. The little secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits\n
      \ doing the same ordinary thing as the same ordinary company next door. The
      reason\n  you make money is you know a couple of little things that enable you
      to take better\n  care of your customers, buy better, or charge a little extra.
      All the little things\n  are what make up your intellectual property and what
      contribute extensively to your\n  bottom line. Therefore, the more you can grow
      your intellectual property, the more\n  intellectual capital you will have and
      the more profit you will make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  contacts and connections
      are intellectual property. Look at your Rolodex and figure\n  out what a contact
      in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these contacts are worth quite\n  a bit. Unfortunately,
      for most of us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be\n  measured in monetary
      terms. These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However,
      they don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n
      \ be translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and
      your\n  business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly
      attach a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value
      of the purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What
      is the value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say,
      &quot;Hi&quot; but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing
      to nurture and grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize
      people who could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like,
      and trust you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply
      because you have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term
      relationships you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business
      asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n
      \ capital needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve
      heard\n  the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital.
      This is true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to
      have an appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize
      on opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than
      just having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point. In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored above\n  average, your
      margins should be funding your growth vs. constantly having to borrow\n  money.
      Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate amount of debt\n  for
      any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Continue your financial diligence and
      use\n  debt as a weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong?\n  If not, what can you do with your financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance,\n  a manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot;\n  the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments.\n  He used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things you can do\n  that your financially weaker
      competitors cannot because of their financial status.\n  Consider doing one
      or more of these things to create a competitive &quot;moat&quot;\n  to protect
      you from your competition.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n

      /></p>\\r\\n<p>Bill\n  Gates has said, &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft
      would be an insignificant\n  company.&quot; A great business cannot run without
      great people. You have been successful\n  at attracting and retaining top talent.
      You have done a good job competing with\n  big businesses in regard to this.
      Alternatively, you may have figured out a strategy\n  that enables you to work
      without &quot;superstars,&quot; yet still have a well-run\n  business. Keep
      in mind there is an asset not listed on your balance sheet called\n  human capital.
      This human capital consists of workers’ knowledge base, their abilities,\n  their
      relationships with customers, and their ability to execute your business plan.\n
      \ All these components add up to the value of these employees to your business.
      The\n  more talented and tenured an employee, the more valuable he or she is.
      You have\n  retained your talented staff after spending time, energy, and effort
      to teach them\n  what is necessary to be useful to your business. Talent will
      flow to its highest\n  and best use. Continue to carve out areas where talented
      people’s best use is working\n  for you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many
      business-to-business enterprises\n  feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the
      Proctor &amp; Gambles and the Gillettes\n  of the world. Every business has
      a brand, whether they want one or not. A brand\n  does not need to be overly
      complicated. A brand is what your company &quot;means&quot;\n  to your customers.
      It’s that simple. You want your brand to mean &quot;excellent\n  service and
      great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers on time, every time.&quot; You\n  don’t
      want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much more expensive than I thought,&quot;\n
      \ or &quot;they don’t really care about their customers,&quot; or &quot;they
      make\n  a mess every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your
      brand DOES mean\n  something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something
      positive in their\n  eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is
      strong. How can you make\n  it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase
      to the customer, so be careful\n  not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad
      ideas include: Burger King underwear,\n  Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter
      energy drink, and Trump steaks. Instead, create\n  a new brand or sub-brand.
      For instance, Toyota markets inexpensive Chinese-made\n  cars under the Scion
      brand rather than adding another model under the Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since\n
      \ you scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect your current brands
      and add\n  powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long Tail? One
      of the principles\n  of the Long Tail is as markets mature, more and more products
      make up 100% of the\n  sales. When markets are new, a handful of products may
      comprise 80% of the sales.\n  However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;
      or winning products make up\n  only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises
      80%. Most small businesses can’t\n  compete on the Head. Therefore, we should
      pick a place on the Long Tail that we\n  can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:

      Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  is
      your Rolodex under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write down
      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&amp;D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital. During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and
      profit from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21

      ! \"<h4>You scored below average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>In order to create\n
      \ an outstanding business model, you must improve your competitive advantage.
      You\n  must also be able to sustain this advantage over the long-term to have
      a stellar\n  business model. Look at AOL, all airlines other than Southwest,
      and Webvan (a former\n  $900MM grocery delivery company) as examples of a good
      model gone awry.</p>\\r\\n<p>You\n  have some work to do creating additional

      competitive advantage.</p>\\r\\n<p>An excellent\n  model for creating ongoing

      /></h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The\n  Hotel California.</em>
      Like the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you like,\n  but you can
      never leave.&quot; Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective at\n  making
      it contractually or emotionally difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning\n
      \ the standard.</em> Microsoft owns many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office,\n  you may be hurting yourself more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able\n  to share a standardized format document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors.\n  You may not like MS Office, but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it.\n  Many industrial companies besides Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the\n  standard. If you can accomplish this,
      it is difficult or impossible for your customers\n  to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n
      \\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching cost.</em> Once you have\n  spent a million dollars
      implementing SAP software, you are less likely to switch\n  to a different software
      company because of the cost and headache involved. Find\n  ways to build switching
      cost into your product or service. Switching cost can take\n  the form of dollar
      cost, emotional cost, organizational inertia, or risk, individually\n  or in
      any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low value gained by switching.</em>\n
      \ Remember when you could switch long distance companies and cut your bill in
      half?\n  It was a bit of a hassle to switch, but the savings were huge. These
      days, you save\n  virtually nothing by switching long-distance carriers. That’s
      why telemarketers\n  are no longer calling to get you to switch long distance
      companies. It simply doesn’t\n  result in enough savings for you to go to the
      bother. Keep your pricing and value\n  bundle close to that of your competition
      so the switching cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>\n
      \ Nothing says, &quot;You can't quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations\n  can be difficult and sometimes a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want\n  to sell your business someday, get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more\n  accurately determined with a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts\n  with the best vendor terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want
      to stock it, there goes 35% of\n  the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Continuous
      R&amp;D needed. Your R&amp;D spending may\n  serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to
      protect you from competitors. If ongoing R&D spending\n  is needed, an under-funded
      competitor will not be able to continue spending after\n  their initial entry
      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex
      or contacts. Your lifelong relationships with people that know, like, and\n
      \ trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Access to capital.
      Sometimes\n  the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>First\n
      \ mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the\n  market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Crest\n
      \ - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty
      synthetic\n  detergent</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery

      service.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n
      \ ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor
      entry\n  barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape.
      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>How would you rate your current competitive advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>Will\n
      \ you be able to sustain your competitive advantage? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>What is
      the single\n  most important action you can take to improve your competitive
      advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage?
      Can it be mitigated? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you create customer exit barriers?
      How long would this increase average retention?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  can you
      do to erect a &quot;moat&quot; around your business by creating competitor\n
      \ entry barriers?</p>\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down the names\n  of your five best customers. Assume a competitor is aggressively
      targeting those\n  five customers. The competitor will do everything in their
      power to steal those\n  customers from you. What will you do to stop this from
      happening? Pick the top two\n  action items that will aid in retaining each
      customer and do them! If any of these\n  action items are organizational improvements,
      implement them organization-wide.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently\n  enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer.\n  Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone\n
      \ assign someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of
      your competitors\n  if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      powerful\n  technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo
      Hunt&quot; to\n  a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where
      we look long and\n  hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start
      all over again. Not only\n  is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a
      business this way. There are proven\n  methods to move away from the Buffalo
      Hunt and toward a recurring revenue model.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:30:15.833709000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>You scored well on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>It is not enough to create\n
      \ a current competitive advantage. You must be able to sustain this advantage
      over\n  the long term to have a stellar business model. Look at AOL, all airlines
      other\n  than Southwest, and Webvan (a former $900MM grocery delivery company)
      as examples\n  of good models gone awry.</p>\\r\\n<p>You have created a model
      with some insulation\n  from the changing competitive landscape. Consider the
      finer points below to reassess\n  your ongoing competitive advantage.</p>\\r\\n<p>An
      excellent model for creating ongoing\n  competitive advantage contains:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Customer

      /></h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The Hotel California.</em>\n  Like
      the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you like, but you can never\n
      \ leave.&quot; Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective at making it
      contractually\n  or emotionally difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning
      the standard.</em>\n  Microsoft owns many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office, you may be hurting\n  yourself more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able to share a standardized\n  format document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors. You may not like MS\n  Office, but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it. Many industrial companies\n  besides Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the standard. If you can accomplish\n  this,
      it is difficult or impossible for your customers to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching\n
      \ cost.</em> Once you have spent a million dollars implementing SAP software,
      you\n  are less likely to switch to a different software company because of
      the cost and\n  headache involved. Find ways to build switching cost into your
      product or service.\n  Switching cost can take the form of dollar cost, emotional
      cost, organizational\n  inertia, or risk, individually or in any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low\n
      \ value gained by switching.</em> Remember when you could switch long distance
      companies\n  and cut your bill in half? It was a bit of a hassle to switch,
      but the savings were\n  huge. These days, you save virtually nothing by switching
      long-distance carriers.\n  That’s why telemarketers are no longer calling to
      get you to switch long distance\n  companies. It simply doesn’t result in enough
      savings for you to go to the bother.\n  Keep your pricing and value bundle close
      to that of your competition so the switching\n  cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>
      Nothing says, &quot;You can't\n  quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations can be difficult and sometimes\n  a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want to sell your business someday,\n  get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more accurately determined with\n  a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts with the best vendor\n  terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h4>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h4>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want
      to stock it, there goes 35% of\n  the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Continuous
      R&amp;D needed. Your R&amp;D spending may\n  serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to
      protect you from competitors. If ongoing R&D spending\n  is needed, an under-funded
      competitor will not be able to continue spending after\n  their initial entry
      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex
      or contacts. Your lifelong relationships with people that know, like, and\n
      \ trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Access to capital.
      Sometimes\n  the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>First\n
      \ mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the\n  market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Crest\n
      \ - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty
      synthetic\n  detergent</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery
      service</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>FedEx\n  - 1st overnight package delivery
      service.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n
      \ ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor
      entry\n  barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape.
      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Will you be able to sustain your competitive advantage?
      How?</p>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  it possible to improve your competitive advantage? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      is the single\n  most important action you can take to improve your competitive
      advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage?
      Can it be mitigated? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you create barriers of exit
      for your customers?  How long would this increase\n  average retention?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      can you do to erect a &quot;moat&quot; around\n  your business by creating competitor
      entry barriers?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Write\n  down the names
      of your five best customers. Assume a competitor is aggressively\n  targeting
      those five customers. The competitor will do everything in their power\n  to
      steal those customers from you. What will you do to stop this from happening?\n
      \ Pick the top two action items that will aid in retaining each customer and
      do them!\n  If any of these action items are organizational improvements, implement
      them organization-wide.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently\n  enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer.\n  Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone\n
      \ assign someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of
      your competitors\n  if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      powerful\n  technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo
      Hunt&quot; to\n  a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where
      we look long and\n  hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start
      all over again. Not only\n  is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a
      business this way. There are proven\n  methods to move away from the Buffalo
      Hunt and toward a recurring revenue model.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:30:15.845582000Z\nupdated_at:

      \ Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In order
      to have a successful\n  business you must build upon quality customers. If you
      have too much churn in your\n  customer base, if your customers cannot pay you,
      or if your customers are so difficult\n  they strain the organization, you do
      not have quality customers. Dealing with low-quality\n  customers will force
      you to devote precious organizational resources to activities\n  that do not
      grow your business. Fortunately, you do not have many of these issues.\n  Your
      focus can move toward adding even higher quality customers and retaining the\n
      \ ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ our customers overly price conscious? If customers have their eye on nothing
      but\n  price, it’s very difficult for most businesses to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what\n  needs to be done is to find the customers who are going to
      attribute value to something,\n  other than sales price. If that cannot be accomplished,
      you are selling a product\n  which the customer perceives as somewhat generic.
      You need to work on your brand\n  to overcome this. Branding can allow you to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace,\n  and charge a premium for some
      attribute other than the generic product. This attribute\n  does not need to
      be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences. For example,\n  all
      the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and\n
      \ a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In\n
      \ every business relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate\n
      \ terms.&quot; Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate\n
      \ many of the business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics\n
      \ in the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies,
      these\n  seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance,\n  many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web
      to &quot;force&quot;\n  customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating\n  terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this
      is a minor &quot;term&quot;\n  to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor\n  dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same\n  way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business\n  stories about vendors that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies\n  like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers\n  are not quality customers because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A\n  quality customer
      isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently\n
      \ provides many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers,\n  sometimes they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration\n  of quality customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime\n  value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are\n  in a business with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a\n  new customer is $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell,\n  on average, $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend\n  half the lifetime value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario,\n  the cost of attraction
      vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer\n  is horrible. To
      improve this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower\n  the cost
      of acquiring the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There\n
      \ are several questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895691906.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"
      style=\\\"float:\n  right; margin-left: 10px;\\\" />What is difficult about
      attracting customers? Attracting\n  customers is difficult for every business.
      I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t\n  opening a Cheesecake Factory here.&quot;
      I said this because when the Cheesecake\n  Factory opened in my hometown, the
      lines were incredibly long, even during non-peak\n  times. They had two-hour
      waits at 2pm on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.\n  I stood in that
      line with a guy who told me that his brother worked in business\n  development
      for the Cheesecake Factory. He related that they sent his brother to\n  a new
      location one year ahead of the store opening to develop trade accounts, talk\n
      \ up the opening, etc. The moral of this story is, even the businesses that
      are seemingly\n  &quot;beating away customers&quot; have worked hard to get
      them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do\n  you know the easy places to find customers?
      Are you paying expensive sales people\n  to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive marketing? Are you over-marketing\n  when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you need a branding makeover because\n  your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you compensating for your weak brand\n  through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your price or putting extra emphasis\n  on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How
      long are\n  you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their customers\n  and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just do good work.\n  There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will allow you to\n  retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job. This does\n  not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1325876401721778.png\\\" alt=\\\"Customer Profitability\n
      \ Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Rank
      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have. Do they demand excessive\n  discounts even though they pay
      net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated\n  with carrying their accounts
      receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time\n  or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis\n  is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they\n  thought was their
      fourth best is actually their best customer and the one they thought\n  was
      their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult\n
      \ decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some
      customers\n  tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more
      money by not selling\n  to them. This is always a difficult realization because
      most business owners are\n  programmed to think that there is no such thing
      as a bad customer, and that anyone\n  who gives you money is a good customer.
      This is usually true. But occasionally,\n  it can be false. I encourage you
      to do a customer analysis annually to see what\n  the true margin provided by
      each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price\n  consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never\n  about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to\n  pay a
      certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features\n
      \ and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s
      add\n  value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly
      while providing\n  better value to the customer. This extra value may be in
      the form of a new or modified\n  product. For instance, make a premium version
      of your product. Figure out how to\n  add features, benefits, and attributes
      and see if that product will command a higher\n  price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate\n  ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years\n  ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market.\n
      \ These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice
      cream\n  became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never
      know what is\n  going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who
      would have figured\n  that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market
      when you can get a similar\n  cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\\r\\n\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      \ Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In order
      to have a successful\n  business you must build upon quality customers. If you
      have too much churn in your\n  customer base, if your customers cannot pay you,
      or if your customers are so difficult\n  they strain the organization, you do
      not have quality customers. Dealing with low-quality\n  customers will force
      you to devote precious organizational resources to activities\n  that do not
      grow your business. Fortunately, you do not have many of these issues.\n  Your
      focus can move toward adding even higher quality customers and retaining the\n
      \ ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h4>The key considerations on quality customers:</h4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even\n
      \ though you have quality customers, are they still price conscious? If customers\n
      \ have their eye on nothing but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to\n  remain profitable. Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers
      who are\n  going to attribute value to something, other than sales price. If
      that cannot be\n  accomplished, you are selling a product which the customer
      perceives as somewhat\n  generic. You need to work on your brand to overcome
      this. Branding can allow you\n  to attack a different segment of the marketplace,
      and charge a premium for some\n  attribute other than the generic product. This
      attribute does not need to be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences.
      For example, all the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You
      squeeze a tube and a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands
      exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In every business\n  relationship,
      one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can
      you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate many of the business\n
      \ terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics in the business
      relationship.\n  If not, you have a problem. For many companies, these seemingly
      insignificant terms\n  add up to a large portion of their profits. For instance,
      many companies have used\n  the self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot;
      customers to be their own\n  customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are
      dictating terms and dramatically\n  lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor
      &quot;term&quot; to the customer, so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor dealing with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same way as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers are not quality customers\n  because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n
      \ isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently
      provides\n  many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers, sometimes\n  they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n
      \ vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To
      improve\n  this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost
      of acquiring\n  the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><img\n

      attracting customers? Attracting\n  customers is difficult for every business.
      I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t\n  opening a Cheesecake Factory here.&quot;
      I said this because when the Cheesecake\n  Factory opened in my hometown, the
      lines were incredibly long, even during non-peak\n  times. They had two-hour
      waits at 2pm on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.\n  I stood in that
      line with a guy who told me that his brother worked in business\n  development
      for the Cheesecake Factory. He related that they sent his brother to\n  a new
      location one year ahead of the store opening to develop trade accounts, talk\n
      \ up the opening, etc. The moral of this story is, even the businesses that
      are seemingly\n  &quot;beating away customers&quot; have worked hard to get
      them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do\n  you know the easy places to find customers?
      Are you paying expensive sales people\n  to sell the product rather than using
      inexpensive marketing? Are you over-marketing\n  when the product simply needs
      to be sold? Do you need a branding makeover because\n  your brand lacks meaning
      to the customer? Are you compensating for your weak brand\n  through other methodologies,
      such as lowering your price or putting extra emphasis\n  on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How
      long are\n  you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their customers\n  and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just do good work.\n  There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will allow you to\n  retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job. This does\n  not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      Probably several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books who were purposely forfeited by\n  your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Run
      a\n  customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      \ Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Rank
      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have.</p>\\r\\n<p>Do they demand\n  excessive discounts even though
      they pay net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital\n  associated with carrying
      their accounts receivable balance versus a customer that\n  pays on time or
      C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What you will find after running this customer\n  cost analysis
      is the customer rankings will change. Many people find out that the\n  customer
      they thought was their fourth best is actually their best customer, and\n  the
      one they thought was their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead\n
      \ you to some difficult decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers.
      You\n  may find that some customers tax the organization to such an extent that
      you will\n  make more money by not selling to them. This is always a difficult
      realization because\n  most business owners are programmed to think that there
      is no such thing as a bad\n  customer, and that anyone who gives you money is
      a good customer. This is usually\n  true. But occasionally, it can be false.
      I encourage you to do a customer analysis\n  annually to see what is the true
      margin provided by each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n  Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we determine the extent\n  of your customers’
      price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot;\n  it’s
      almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer\n
      \ is only going to pay a certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based
      upon\n  the value of features and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather
      than just lowering\n  price, let’s add value instead. This can be a great way
      to increase the price slightly\n  while providing better value to the customer.
      This extra value may be in the form\n  of a new or modified product. For instance,
      make a premium version of your product.\n  Figure out how to add features, benefits,
      and attributes and see if that product\n  will command a higher price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular\n  ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream\n  market twenty years ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny\n  segment of the market.
      These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before\n  long, premium ice
      cream became a very large segment of the total ice cream market.\n  You never
      know what is going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode.\n  Who
      would have figured that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market\n
      \ when you can get a similar cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:34:15.717899000Z\nupdated_at: 2012-01-06

      \ margin-right: 10px;\\\" />I live in the Midwest where there are many ethanol
      refineries.\n  They came into existence at a cost of hundreds of millions of
      dollars each. Then,\n  the price of oil dropped dramatically and this industry
      became nonviable without\n  additional government subsidies. These subsidies
      never did occur and many of these\n  ethanol plants are being shut down before
      ever coming online. The longevity of the\n  industry was not sustainable without
      the high price of oil.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your industry\n  may not be around for a
      long time. I am not advocating changing the business you\n  are in. Once you
      are in a certain business, you are stuck, right? That is partially\n  true,
      but not entirely. For example, think about IBM. How do you define their business?\n
      \ If you define their business as a provider of equipment and automation for
      office\n  workers, their business hasn’t changed much over the years. But when
      you remember\n  that IBM started in office machines, then typewriters, then
      computers, and then\n  service delivery, they have done an excellent job of
      morphing their business model\n  over the years. They were constantly shifting
      into industries and sub-businesses\n  that were growing.</p>\\r\\n<p>All businesses
      can do this if they are open to change.\n  It begins with subtly changing the
      SIC code of the industry you are in. In the 1850s\n  people traveled cross country
      via railroad. Railroads were the people movers. Then\n  in the 1920s and 1930s
      the airline industry was beginning and the railroads saw\n  themselves as a
      railroad and not a people mover. The railroads were flush with lots\n  of cash
      but did nothing to expand into the airline industry because in their minds,\n
      \ they were a railroad. If the railroads had seen themselves as a people-moving
      business,\n  they would have jumped into the airline business, or perhaps even
      the automotive\n  industry.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below average, there
      are some concerns as to\n  the long-term viability of your industry. Ask yourself,
      &quot;Are you really an\n  IT services company or do you help companies improve
      their business process through\n  the use of technology?&quot; Do you see yourself
      as a gadget seller or do you solve\n  a broader customer issue? The issue never
      changes, just what you sell the customer.\n  There’s a bigger picture for everything
      you do. You are always solving a problem\n  for your customers. What you currently
      do is specifically how you solve their problem.\n  However, these specifics
      can change over time. Your opportunities lie in expanding\n  your products or
      services in this strong industry.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Picture\n
      \ it is ten years from now and you are looking into your crystal ball. What
      does the\n  longevity of your business look like in ten years? What is the future
      environment\n  like? Is it better than today, or is it worse? How about twenty
      years from now?\n  Do you still see growth and opportunity in your business?
      If so, you are in great\n  shape. If you have some doubts, analyze things from
      the worst-case perspective.\n  What happens if things play out closer to the
      worst-case scenario rather than your\n  expected or hopeful scenario? Can you

      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50\n  million to buy businesses.
      You and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business\n  right now. I’m going
      to pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business\n  for, $5
      million, $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank.\n
      \ You have a party; you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How

      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      10px;\\\" />The\n  CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO
      Emeritus creates a business\n  that runs very well without their direct daily
      input. The CEO Emeritus works the\n  hours that she wants to work, gets paid
      a terrific salary (what you earn right now\n  or maybe more), does work that
      she wants to do, and performs activities only an\n  owner can; like being the
      head cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist, the keeper\n  of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus\n  Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers\n
      \ The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the Standard Bearer
      is the\n  person that maintains the level of how well the organization performs
      all work.\n  Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are in
      the building versus\n  when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic
      at work. It’s not that you\n  are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present. Your people\n  know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the standard is\n  an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds\n  or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that\n  the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only\n  the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million\n  check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p><img

      style=\\\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\\\" />What do you need\n  to do to
      tweak your business model so your business is worth $20 million? Focus\n  on
      number one and number two of the &quot;A&quot; categories (excellent margins\n
      \ and easy to sell) of Business Model Secrets. If you have excellent margins
      and a\n  product that’s easy to sell, you are well on your way to creating a
      powerful business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are serious about selling your
      business in the next two\n  or three years, go to a business broker. I don’t
      recommend you pay a lot of money\n  for a business assessment; it’s completely
      subjective. Your business is worth what\n  someone will pay for it. The valuation
      is just a number on paper. I have seen people\n  pay too much for businesses,
      and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment\n  says their business
      is worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend spending\n  five or ten
      thousand dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business. However,\n  it’s
      a good exercise to go to a business broker and talk to someone who buys and\n
      \ sells businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable your business is.
      They\n  may have some tips to get your business more saleable and get a fair
      market assessment\n  on the value of your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In
      the\n  Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively on the techniques
      needed to\n  become a CEO Emeritus. Once you have achieved Emeritus status,
      you might not want\n  to sell your business. In our opinion, CEO Emeritus is
      the most graceful of exits.\n  Our biggest challenge with clients is getting
      them to believe that it IS possible\n  to work 10 hours a week and make more
      than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another\n  tactic which can be used for
      a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs\n  have heard horror stories
      about someone who bought a business and it went badly.\n  Bad purchases done
      poorly go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will\n  discuss criteria
      for a good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next\n  level.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your

      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      10px;\\\" />The\n  CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO
      Emeritus creates a business\n  that runs very well without their direct daily
      input. The CEO Emeritus works the\n  hours that she wants to work, gets paid
      a terrific salary (what you earn right now\n  or maybe more), does work that
      she wants to do, and performs activities only an\n  owner can; like being the
      head cheerleader, the visionary, the strategist, the keeper\n  of key customer
      relationships, and the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus\n  Activities
      &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers\n
      \ The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, the Standard Bearer
      is the\n  person that maintains the level of how well the organization performs
      all work.\n  Have you ever noticed your business runs better when you are in
      the building versus\n  when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer dynamic
      at work. It’s not that you\n  are doing anything; it’s just running better because
      you are present. Your people\n  know the standard is higher when you are in
      the building. Bearing the standard is\n  an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The
      16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds\n  or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that\n  the true value
      of the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only\n  the CEO
      can perform. The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency\n  activities
      and can draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing\n
      \ tremendous amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming
      the\n  CEO Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it
      is more financially\n  viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  your business truly saleable for top dollar?
      Many small businesses sell for three\n  to five times their earnings. If you
      are in one of these businesses it makes a lot\n  more sense to create a CEO
      Emeritus situation. You can take your earnings in perpetuity\n  rather than
      cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings. This creates a question:\n  In
      order to create an exit strategy, is your business better situated for you to\n
      \ sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some
      work\n  to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you are working
      to maximize\n  the value of the business for sale to an outside party, or working
      to maximize the\n  value of the income stream for yourself, many of the activities
      overlap. However,\n  if you create a business you can run as a CEO Emeritus,
      you will have created a\n  far more saleable business that will command a much
      higher price-to-earnings multiple.\n  Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside.\n  If you sell your business, it
      will sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus.\n  If you decide not to sell,
      you have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  systems
      or processes are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO\n
      \ Emeritus? The simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from
      the\n  business premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there.
      These issues\n  are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have
      the proper people\n  in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or
      do you have some holes on\n  your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The issue is never as simple
      as &quot;the people,&quot; it’s\n  almost always a system issue instead. Systems
      are much easier to control than people,\n  so I encourage you to start with
      the systems instead of the people. I think you\n  will find your people will
      get better as a result of working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  times
      we are missing a key player on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO\n
      \ Emeritus role. What role would this person fill? How much will you need to
      pay them?\n  Is your need for control holding you back from assuming the CEO
      Emeritus role? Is\n  your need to be involved in all the daily nitty gritty
      holding you back from building\n  a great business that will allow you to become
      a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>What does a business
      just like yours that will sell for $20 million\n  look like? How much money
      does that business make? What activities does that CEO\n  do every day, week,
      and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What\n  are the differences
      between that business and yours? Write down five things that\n  need to happen
      in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get\n  to work
      on one or two of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will your business model enable you make\n
      \ your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million\n  check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a
      safe way to not\n  only build a great business, but a valuable one as well.
      You will also need to have\n  an outstanding, proprietary business model. No
      one is going to write a $20 million\n  check for a me-too business.</p>\\r\\n<p><img
      src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1325884218532087.png\\\"\n  alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"
      style=\\\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\\\" />What do you need\n  to do to
      tweak your business model so your business is worth $20 million? Focus\n  on
      number one and number two of the &quot;A&quot; categories (excellent margins\n
      \ and easy to sell) of Business Model Secrets. If you have excellent margins
      and a\n  product that’s easy to sell, you are well on your way to creating a
      powerful business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are serious about selling your
      business in the next two\n  or three years, visit a business broker. I don’t
      recommend you pay a lot of money\n  for a business assessment; it’s completely
      subjective. Your business is worth what\n  someone will pay for it. The valuation
      is just a number on paper. I have seen people\n  pay too much for businesses,
      and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment\n  says their business
      is worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend spending\n  five or ten
      thousand dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business. However,\n  it’s
      a good exercise to go to a business broker and talk to someone who buys and\n
      \ sells businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable your business is.
      They\n  may have some tips to get your business more saleable and get a fair
      market assessment\n  on the value of your business.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>In
      the\n  Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively on the techniques
      needed to\n  become a CEO Emeritus. Once you have achieved Emeritus status,
      you might not want\n  to sell your business. In our opinion, CEO Emeritus is
      the most graceful of exits.\n  Our biggest challenge with clients is getting
      them to believe that it IS possible\n  to work 10 hours a week and make more
      than they are making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another\n  tactic which can be used for
      a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs\n  have heard horror stories
      about someone who bought a business and it went badly.\n  Bad purchases done
      poorly go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program, we will\n  discuss criteria
      for a good plug-in acquisition that could catapult you to the next\n  level.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      away from trends, especially short-lived trends, if your model does\n  not have

      left; margin-right: 10px;\\\"\n  /></p>\\r\\n<p>Another point of concern is
      when the business owner doesn’t like to\n  &quot;deal with the money.&quot;
      Some of these types of owners have abdicated financial\n  control of their business.
      At a minimum, you should always hand sign your checks.\n  This will give you
      some control over the money. You can delegate 98% of the financial\n  function,
      but the high-level ownership role (a.k.a. CEO Emeritus) should keep at\n  least
      2% of financial control.</p>\\r\\n<p>For instance, playing the role of the true\n
      \ CFO, maintaining the banking relationship, or maintaining the high-level financial\n
      \ relationships are CEO Emeritus roles. You should have a level of understanding
      of\n  your key performance indicators (KPIs), your profitability, as well as
      your balance\n  sheet in order to have a truly great business and business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another\n
      \ potential pitfall is location. You’ve heard the real estate adage, location,
      location,\n  location. In a business to business environment, location isn’t
      necessarily a handicap.\n  However, most businesses pull their labor force from
      within a tight radius of their\n  physical location. If you cannot find qualified
      personnel due to your location,\n  you could have a problem hiring and recruiting
      talented people.</p>\\r\\n<p>What happens\n  if the price of gasoline goes to
      $10 a gallon resulting in a huge shipping problem?\n  I was in a business where
      we had a very heavy product which limited us to a 500\n  mile shipping radius.
      Plus, it was a deposit-type product, so there were two-way\n  freight charges.
      If gas prices went to $10 a gallon, we would have to reduce the\n  shipping
      radius from 500 hundred miles to 250 miles and lose all the metropolitan\n  areas
      outside of the 250 mile radius. Does your existing business plan accommodate\n
      \ these types of issues?</p>\\r\\n<p>The Pitfall section contains a special
      component\n  called the &quot;Taser Test.&quot; Taser has a terrific business
      model. Their stun\n  guns are a highly proprietary product. They invented the
      market for stun guns. It’s\n  a very high-margin product. It’s a beloved brand.
      Taser has everything going for\n  it - other than a lawsuit filed every month
      for several million dollars. Even if\n  Taser wins most of these lawsuits, which
      they do, they still have an incredible\n  legal bill. Taser has to budget for
      this legal bill and it eats into their profits\n  substantially. It doesn’t
      matter if they win or lose; they are going to get sued\n  regularly. Does your
      business have a similar issue? Are you going to be prone to\n  lawsuits or unnecessary
      expenses simply because of the business model that you are\n  operating?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Are there pitfalls in your business\n  model? Your
      first inclination is to say, &quot;No.&quot; This is the fair and accurate\n
      \ 90% of the time. Is there a way to mitigate or eliminate any and all pitfalls?
      Let’s\n  go back to Taser. If Taser could push through legislation which said
      Taser is a\n  valuable asset to law enforcement, and therefore any Taser used
      in law enforcement\n  is automatically immune from any lawsuit, how would that
      alter Taser’s business\n  model? Substantially, right? Is there a similar change
      you can make to your model?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Find yourself
      a sounding-board partner to do the following exercise.\n  It is known by you
      and your partner that it is possible to remove any pitfalls that\n  may exist
      in your business. How does this happen? Remember, it’s KNOWN to be possible.\n
      \ No, &quot;yeah but&quot; excuses! No, &quot;I can’t because.&quot; It IS possible\n
      \ to remove or greatly mitigate all pitfalls in your business. How does this
      come\n  about from where you are currently? What does this picture look like?
      Think long\n  and hard, use the sounding-board partner, and be nothing but positive.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n
      \ Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Mitigating pitfalls can be difficult. Many CEOs say,
      &quot;There\n  is nothing I can do about this.&quot; Here is a great example
      of a Business Model\n  Secrets program success story. This particular client
      used a tremendous amount of\n  extruded aluminum. As commodity prices fluctuated
      wildly, he was losing money on\n  some bids because his quote to the customer
      was a fixed price but his raw materials\n  cost went up or down unpredictably.
      As a solution to this issue, we convinced him\n  to purchase a futures contract
      on aluminum. If prices went up, he would lose money\n  on aluminum purchases,
      but he would make it back on the futures contract. If prices\n  went down, he
      would lose money on the futures contract but get cost savings. This\n  technique
      effectively removed the pitfall.</p>\\r\\n<p>There are also several quick\n
      \ and easy legal tricks to dramatically lower risk. One of them costs only $100.

      instance, playing the\n  role of the true CFO, maintaining the banking relationship,
      or maintaining the high\n  level financial relationships are CEO Emeritus roles.
      You should have a level of\n  understanding of your critical performance indicators,
      your profitability as well\n  as your balance sheet in order to truly have a
      great business and a great business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another potential
      pitfall is location. You’ve heard the real estate\n  adage, location, location,
      location. In a business to business environment, location\n  isn’t necessarily
      a handicap. However, most businesses pull their labor force from\n  within a
      tight radius of their physical location. If you cannot find qualified personnel\n
      \ due to your location, you could have a problem hiring and recruiting talented
      people.</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  happens if the price of gasoline goes to $10 a gallon
      resulting in a huge shipping\n  problem? I was in a business where we had a
      very heavy product which limited us\n  to a 500 mile shipping radius. Plus,
      it was a deposit-type product, so there were\n  two-way freight charges. If
      gas prices went to $10 a gallon, we would have to reduce\n  the shipping radius
      from 500 hundred miles to 250 miles and lose all the metropolitan\n  areas outside
      of the 250 mile radius. Does your existing business plan accommodate\n  these
      types of issues?</p>\\r\\n<p>The Pitfall section contains a special component\n
      \ called the &quot;Taser Test.&quot; Taser has a terrific business model. Their
      stun\n  guns are a highly proprietary product. They invented the market for
      stun guns. It’s\n  a very high-margin product. It’s a beloved brand. Taser has
      everything going for\n  it - other than a lawsuit filed every month for several
      million dollars. Even if\n  Taser wins most of these lawsuits, which they do,
      they still have an incredible\n  legal bill. Taser has to budget for this legal
      bill and it eats into their profits\n  substantially. It doesn’t matter if they
      win or lose; they are going to get sued\n  regularly. Does your business have
      a similar issue? Are you going to be prone to\n  lawsuits or unnecessary expenses
      simply because of the business model that you are\n  operating?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points
      to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<p>Are there pitfalls in your business\n  model? Your
      first inclination is to say, &quot;No.&quot; This is the fair and accurate\n
      \ 90% of the time. Is there a way to mitigate or eliminate any and all pitfalls?
      Let’s\n  go back to Taser. If Taser could push through legislation which said
      Taser is a\n  valuable asset to law enforcement, and therefore any Taser used
      in law enforcement\n  is automatically immune from any lawsuit, how would that
      alter Taser’s business\n  model? Substantially, right? Is there a similar change
      you can make to your model?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>Find yourself
      a sounding-board partner to do the following exercise.\n  It is known by you
      and your partner that it is possible to remove any pitfalls that\n  may exist
      in your business. How does this happen? Remember, it’s KNOWN to be possible.\n
      \ No, &quot;yeah but&quot; excuses! No, &quot;I can’t because.&quot; It IS possible\n
      \ to remove or greatly mitigate all pitfalls in your business. How does this
      come\n  about from where you are currently? What does this picture look like?
      Think long\n  and hard, use the sounding-board partner, and be nothing but positive.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced\n
      \ Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Mitigating pitfalls can be difficult. Many CEOs say,
      &quot;There\n  is nothing I can do about this.&quot; Here is a great example
      of a Business Model\n  Secrets program success story. This particular client
      used a tremendous amount of\n  extruded aluminum. As commodity prices fluctuated
      wildly, he was losing money on\n  some bids because his quote to the customer
      was a fixed price but his raw materials\n  cost went up or down unpredictably.
      As a solution to this issue, we convinced him\n  to purchase a futures contract
      on aluminum. If prices went up, he would lose money\n  on aluminum purchases,
      but he would make it back on the futures contract. If prices\n  went down, he
      would lose money on the futures contract but get cost savings. This\n  technique
      effectively removed the pitfall.</p>\\r\\n<p>There are also several quick\n
      \ and easy legal tricks to dramatically lower risk. One of them costs only $100.
      We\n  discuss these methods in the Business Model Secrets Advanced Course.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      ! \"<h2>Your margins vs. your industry are low.</h2>\\r\\n<p>Your challenge\n
      \ is to create dramatically improve your margins. There is no such thing as
      a great\n  company that does not have great margins. The two go together. You
      need to begin\n  to innovate and refine your business model to grow your margins.
      You may have bad\n  competitors crowding the marketplace and eroding your margin.
      Can you differentiate\n  your product to command higher margins? What additional
      value or features can you\n  add to the offering to allow you to charge more?
      Are there dramatic cost saving\n  opportunities? Remember, no margin, no mission.</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      may need to start\n  fresh. You will continue to struggle if you do not raise
      margins. It may be difficult\n  or impossible to modify your existing offerings
      to dramatically raise margins. If\n  this is the case, you may be better off
      to add a new offering rather than modify\n  a flawed one. Many great companies
      were born as small trial divisions of failed\n  companies. Toys'R'Us us was
      a small division of a failed retailer. CarMax was a\n  division of Circuit City.
      Consider introducing a high-margin product or service\n  that could turn into
      a significant portion of your revenue.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472286719.jpg\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h2>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<p>What steps, philosophies and business practices have
      you\n  used to create your best margin products and services? Don’t get caught
      up in the\n  specifics of how you did it, stick to the philosophies that got
      you there. Over\n  time, all business models erode, as will yours. It will not
      be in minutes, weeks\n  or months. It will be over the course of years or decades.
      However, all business\n  models do erode over time. You need to continue to
      innovate your business model,\n  your products, and your services to allow for
      higher margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>What new\n  products or services can you add to
      your offerings to make margins even higher?\n  What products or services can
      you withdraw from your offerings to increase the overall\n  margin of the company?</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times these marginal products and services\n  drain company resources and don’t
      add to the bottom line significantly. Many times\n  companies can run better
      and more profitably simply by reducing products or service\n  offerings, or
      even firing customers.</p>\\r\\n<p>By firing customers, the objective\n  is
      to not only get away from customers who are a pain, but to get away from customers\n
      \ who are draining organizational resources. These customers do not provide
      profit\n  commensurate with the resources they consume.</p>\\r\\n<p>Do you have
      the luxury of\n  ignoring bad competition or all competition? You most likely
      cannot. There’s an\n  old saying in business, the fastest way out of business
      is imitating your competitors.\n  We don’t want to always be looking in the
      rear view mirror at our competitors. Have\n  we been doing this? How much of
      our margin issue is due to bad or excessive competition?\n  How can we differentiate
      ourselves to gently exit this over-competitive market?\n  We are far better
      off to be in a smaller segment wit excellent margins than to be\n  in the “shark-tank”
      fighting for the big part of the market.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Engage\n
      \ in customer analysis and see if any customer needs to be fired to continue
      to grow\n  our margin. See the example below for a starting point.<br /><img
      src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1325876401721778.png\\\"\n  alt=\\\"Customer
      Profitability Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\"\n  /></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Brainstorm
      ideas for creative new products or services only if\n  they will be higher margin
      than existing items.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Make a list of product\n  or service offerings
      that are below average margin and consider dropping them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ new customer groups or industries can you sell to that will provide additional
      profitable\n  outlets for your products and services.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Consider
      purchasing a weaker\n  competitor to stave off the creation of a bad competitor.</li>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced\n
      \ Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>Guess what the most profitable industry in the Fortune
      500\n  is? No, it is not oil. It’s insurance. We have a little-known secret
      at The Business\n  Model Institute: everyone should be in the insurance business.
      It isn’t what you\n  think. We don’t want you to sell life insurance. However,
      insurance is nothing more\n  than accepting risk for money. We make customers
      accept transactional risk they\n  would prefer not to take. There are tactics
      to remove this risk and get paid very\n  well.</p>\\r\\n<p>The insurance portion
      of your operation should be the most profitable\n  aspect of your company. We
      will teach you what your plumber knows that can double\n  your margins.</p>\\r\\n<p>Also,
      we want you to learn what product we all gladly purchase\n  every month (for
      $88 per ounce) that is more expensive than Russian Caviar and has\n  super-high
      margins. You can use this example to create your own version of this\n  super-high
      profit product.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:07:37.062722000Z\nupdated_at:

      business model is the proprietary\n  methodology used to acquire, service, and
      retain customers.&quot; &mdash; Jim Muehlhausen,\n  Author &quot;The 51 Fatal
      Business Errors and How to Avoid Them&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  business model
      is your secret sauce. Your model is what makes your business unique.\n  Your
      business model is the formula you use to outsmart your competitors, provide\n
      \ ongoing value to customers, and continually grow your business. There are
      eight\n  essential areas to a business model:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      have excellent margins</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n  be easy to sell</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      have The Four Capitals&copy;: Intellectual Capital,\n  Financial Capital, Human
      Capital and Brand Capital</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must be able to\n  maintain ongoing
      competitive advantage</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must have quality customers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n
      \ have longevity of the industry</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must provide for the owner’s
      graceful\n  exit</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must avoid pitfalls</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Not
      all the areas carry\n  an equal weight. As you can see from the graph of the
      section weighs below, the\n  combination of excellent margins plus an easy to
      sell product account for over one\n  half of the total score. Significant research
      has gone into this scoring process\n  to assess your business model with the
      greatest accuracy. Remember that your competitors\n  are actively working to
      improve there competitive position and therefore business\n  models erode over
      time. No matter what your score, your best source of competitive\n  advantage
      is to be continually actively working to refine and improve your business\n
      \ model.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1323378575149393.jpg\\\"
      alt=\\\"The\n  Ideal Business Model\\\" title=\\\"The Ideal Business Model\\\"
      /></p>\\r\\n<p>In the past,\n  you may not have given much thought to your business
      model. Most business books\n  teach us that our business plan is the most important
      tool for managing our business\n  success. However, a stellar business plan
      is not much good without a solid business\n  model behind it.</p>\\r\\n<div
      style=\\\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-align:\n  center;\\\">Great
      business plan + bad business model = a bad business</div>\\r\\n<div\n  style=\\\"font-weight:
      bold; font-style: italic; text-align: center;\\\">Average business\n  plan +
      great business model = a great business</div>\\r\\n<p>Previously, there were\n
      \ no objective criteria for gauging the quality of a business model. Venture
      capitalists\n  and bankers had been judging business models for years, but on
      subjective, gut impressions.\n  Our model uses a scientific, objective approach
      to grading an existing business\n  model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are still not sold
      on the importance of your business model,\n  ponder this: all business models
      will go stale if unaltered. Typically, this process\n  takes ten to twenty years.
      Here are some examples:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockbuster\n  video made
      hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in the 1990’s and commanded\n  a
      90% market share. Today it is nearly defunct.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IBM has successfully\n
      \ morphed its business model several times over the years in order to remain
      successful\n  vs. Xerox and Kodak who have not.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Radio stations
      were a profitable\n  cash cow for decades until iPods came along.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If
      you were Wal-Mart\n  in the 1990s, would you have figured that your biggest
      competitor would be Amazon.com?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>For\n  many retailers, the
      tried and true Yellow Pages method of customer attraction has\n  stopped working.
      Successful retailers have changed their client attraction model\n  to continue
      their success.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>This Business Model Evaluator Report\n
      \ below has several specific suggestions how to innovate biz model. Work with
      your\n  consulting partner to implement these solutions and watch your business
      grow.</p>\"\nid: 1\n"

      ! \"<h2>You scored low on this aspect.</h2>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Intellectual Capital.</h2>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h2>Financial capital.</h2>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Human Capital</h2>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n
      \ class=\\\"left\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates is
      quoted as saying,\n  &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an
      insignificant company.&quot;\n  A great business cannot run without great people
      and your business has been successful\n  attracting and retaining top talent.
      You may have struggled competing with big businesses\n  regarding this. Have
      you figured out a strategy to work without &quot;superstars&quot;\n  yet still
      have a well-running business? This is a &quot;must for many small businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep\n
      \ in mind that there is an asset, not list on your balance sheet, called human
      capital.\n  This human capital consists of the worker’s knowledge base, their
      abilities, their\n  relationship with customers, and their ability to execute
      your business plan., All\n  these components add up to the intangible value
      of those employees to your business.\n  The more talented and tenured an employee,
      the more valuable he or she is to your\n  business. You have retained your talented
      staff after spending time, energy and\n  effort to teach them the knowledge
      necessary which to be useful to our business.\n  Talent will flow to its highest
      and best use. Continue to carve out areas where\n  talented people’s best &quot;use&quot;
      is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Brand Capital</h2>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  business-to-business
      enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor\n  &amp; Gambles
      and the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether\n  they
      want one or not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand is\n
      \ what your company &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple. You
      want\n  your brand to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or
      &quot;delivers\n  on time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be
      perceived as, &quot;much\n  more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they
      don’t really care about their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess
      every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES
      mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive
      in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How
      can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n
      \ so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n
      \ King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump
      steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets
      inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another
      model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this
      aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and add powerful new ones.
      Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long
      Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales.
      When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales.
      However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products
      make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small
      businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on
      the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
      center;\\\"><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"
      alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These
      days, with so much global competition\n  and so many options for every customer,
      there is virtually no industry that does\n  not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition crushes margins. Branding\n  to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is a way to battle this. Can\n  market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot;\n  If there
      was market data on some great new niche, it would be obvious to everyone.\n
      \ The only way to create a powerful niche on the long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not\n  a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey guess. You may
      be blindfolded,\n  but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen for tiny
      clues from your customers,\n  vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs
      are latent; they won’t jump up\n  and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a $3 cup of coffee, or a personal\n  computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the idea, despite any data, and created\n  something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n
      \ you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How is your
      Rolodex\n  under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Action\n  Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write down
      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&amp;D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital.During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and profit
      from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-18 00:44:49.399686000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h4>Congratulations, you scored above average on this aspect.</h4>\\r\\n<p>The\n
      \ four capitals are comprised of intellectual capital, financial capital, human
      capital\n  and brand capital. Your score is a composite average of all four
      areas. We’ll run\n  through them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Intellectual Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Your
      high score\n  indicates you may have some valuable intellectual capital. Every
      business sells\n  intellectual property. Intellectual property isn’t just for
      doctors, patent attorneys,\n  accountants and chip designers. Everyone is in
      the idea, or intellectual property,\n  business. If you make widgets, is it
      the generic making of the widgets that generates\n  the profit, probably not?
      More likely, it is your proprietary way of making the\n  widgets, or your secret
      vendors, or the way you train your staff that accounts for\n  the profits. These
      are all examples of intellectual property. The only true asset\n  your business
      has is the ability to generate a profit doing the things you do the\n  way you
      do them. The little secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits\n
      \ doing the same ordinary thing as the same ordinary company next door. The
      reason\n  you make money is you know a couple of little things that enable you
      to take better\n  care of your customers, buy better, or charge a little extra.
      All the little things\n  are what make up your intellectual property and what
      contribute extensively to your\n  bottom line. Therefore, the more you can grow
      your intellectual property, the more\n  intellectual capital you will have and
      the more profit you will make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  contacts and connections
      are intellectual property. Look at your Rolodex and figure\n  out what a contact
      in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these contacts are worth quite\n  a bit. Unfortunately,
      for most of us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be\n  measured in monetary
      terms. These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However,
      they don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n
      \ be translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and
      your\n  business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly
      attach a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value
      of the purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What
      is the value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say,
      &quot;Hi&quot; but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing
      to nurture and grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize
      people who could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like,
      and trust you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply
      because you have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term
      relationships you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business
      asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n
      \ capital needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve
      heard\n  the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital.
      This is true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to
      have an appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize
      on opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than
      just having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point. In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored above\n  average, your
      margins should be funding your growth vs. constantly having to borrow\n  money.
      Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate amount of debt\n  for
      any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Continue your financial diligence and
      use\n  debt as a weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong?\n  If not, what can you do with your financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance,\n  a manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot;\n  the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments.\n  He used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things you can do\n  that your financially weaker
      competitors cannot because of their financial status.\n  Consider doing one
      or more of these things to create a competitive &quot;moat&quot;\n  to protect
      you from your competition.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Human Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n
      \ class=\\\"left\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates has
      said, &quot;Without\n  our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant
      company.&quot; A great business\n  cannot run without great people. You have
      been successful at attracting and retaining\n  top talent. You have done a good
      job competing with big businesses in regard to\n  this. Alternatively, you may
      have figured out a strategy that enables you to work\n  without &quot;superstars,&quot;
      yet still have a well-run business. Keep in mind\n  there is an asset not listed
      on your balance sheet called human capital. This human\n  capital consists of
      workers’ knowledge base, their abilities, their relationships\n  with customers,
      and their ability to execute your business plan. All these components\n  add
      up to the value of these employees to your business. The more talented and tenured\n
      \ an employee, the more valuable he or she is. You have retained your talented
      staff\n  after spending time, energy, and effort to teach them what is necessary
      to be useful\n  to your business. Talent will flow to its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve\n  out areas where talented people’s best use is working for
      you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand\n  Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business enterprises
      feel that &quot;branding&quot;\n  is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles and the Gillettes
      of the world. Every business\n  has a brand, whether they want one or not. A
      brand does not need to be overly complicated.\n  A brand is what your company
      &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.\n  You want your brand
      to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers\n  on
      time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much\n
      \ more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they don’t really care about
      their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess every time we place an order
      with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES mean something to your customers.
      Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive in their eyes. You scored well
      on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How can you make it stronger? Brands
      typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n  so be careful not to overextend
      your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n  King underwear, Kellogg’s
      hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump steaks.\n  Instead, create
      a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets inexpensive\n  Chinese-made
      cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another model under the\n  Toyota
      moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect\n
      \ your current brands and add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about
      the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature,
      more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a
      handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales. However, as the market
      matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products make up only 20% of the
      sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small businesses can’t compete
      on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on the Long Tail that we can
      &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Points\n  to Consider</h4>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How\n  is
      your Rolodex under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n
      \ is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h4>Action\n  Steps</h4>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;
      This is your most valuable intellectual property\n  and your most powerful asset.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better\n  protect it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Write down
      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Advanced
      Techniques</h4>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&amp;D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital. During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and
      profit from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21

      a great\n  company that does not have great margins. The two go together. You
      need to begin\n  to innovate and refine your business model to grow your margins.
      You may have bad\n  competitors crowding the marketplace and eroding your margin.
      Can you differentiate\n  your product to command higher margins? What additional
      value or features can you\n  add to the offering to allow you to charge more?
      Are there dramatic cost saving\n  opportunities? Remember, no margin, no mission.</p>\\r\\n<p>You
      may need to start\n  fresh. You will continue to struggle if you do not raise
      margins. It may be difficult\n  or impossible to modify your existing offerings
      to dramatically raise margins. If\n  this is the case, you may be better off
      to add a new offering rather than modify\n  a flawed one. Many great companies
      were born as small trial divisions of failed\n  companies. Toys'R'Us us was
      a small division of a failed retailer. CarMax was a\n  division of Circuit City.

      you there. Over\n  time, all business models erode, as will yours. It will not
      be in minutes, weeks\n  or months. It will be over the course of years or decades.
      However, all business\n  models do erode over time. You need to continue to

      times these marginal products and services\n  drain company resources and don’t

      and more profitably simply by reducing products or service\n  offerings, or
      even firing customers.</p>\\r\\n<p>By firing customers, the objective\n  is

      \ determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary skill
      can\n  sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson should
      not have\n  to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If
      we could just\n  get some sales superstars in here, we would actually be able
      to accomplish our sales\n  objectives.&quot; A lack of sales superstars is never
      the problem and the quality\n  of the sales staff is almost never the sales
      issue. Typically, the issue is the\n  salability of the product combined with
      potential shortcomings of sales talent.\n  Since you have a highly sellable
      product, you can focus your attention on building\n  a strong sales and marketing
      process to amplify the product’s salability</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074469838890.jpg\\\"
      class=\\\"left\\\" alt=\\\"Selling\n  Ice to Eskimos?\\\" title=\\\"Business
      Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You can do a better\n  job ignoring your own
      opinions and biases regarding &quot;what the customer wants,\n  needs and desires.&quot;
      Instead, listen to the market. You should pay attention\n  to market data, not
      your own subjective opinions. Listening to the market instead\n  of listening
      to you is a great tactic to use to create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product needs to be sold. However, some products need more selling and others
      need\n  more marketing in order to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance,
      insurance\n  tends to be sold more than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed
      more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  easiest way to determine whether your product
      needs to be sold or marketed is to\n  do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot;
      Here is an example: if you could\n  only sell your product and were allowed
      NO marketing, what would happen? This means\n  no brochures, no ads, no commercials,
      nothing resembling marketing at all. It all\n  goes away. You only have your
      sales force. However, you have the best sales force\n  in the world. It’s a
      team of nothing but superstars. What happens to your sales?\n  Do they go up?
      Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over\n  the
      coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people selling. However,\n
      \ the best marketing team in the world works with your product. You get all
      those\n  promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing geniuses,
      Web 2.0 strategies,\n  every terrific marketing technique you can think of is
      implemented. What happens?\n  Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects\n  to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold,\n  and sometimes only partially sold.
      For most businesses, marketing partially sells\n  prospects and the sales force
      needs to do the rest. Answering this question can\n  be very challenging. However,
      it will let you know which is more important for your\n  product or service,
      marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times I see business owners\n  who put
      too much emphasis on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really\n
      \ the marketing. In this case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make
      the\n  product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The second component of easy to sell
      is filling\n  an unserved or underserved market. It’s as simple as comparing
      the demand for the\n  product or service to how many vendors are chasing market
      share. A product is easier\n  to sell in an unserved or underserved market.
      In a crowded market yours ends up\n  being a &quot;me too&quot; product, even
      if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask yourself:\n  How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers\n  would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is\n  closer to,
      &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC\n  contractor
      in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every\n
      \ product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times\n  we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black\n  magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem
      to do it. Perhaps we give\n  them more credit than they deserve. Great sales
      people who move from company to\n  company and continue to sell well do so because
      they are great at understanding\n  how to sell products. This does not mean
      they excel at feature/benefit presentations.\n  The secret of great sales people
      is they are great at creating a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  of the truly
      great sales people do it naturally, without knowing how they do it.\n  They
      create a procedure, a series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless,\n
      \ which result in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every
      company,\n  if you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create
      a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this,
      you probably have a\n  definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      subcomponent of a definable\n  and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal
      prospect be identified and defined?\n  If you don’t know where to find the people
      who buy your products, you will not have\n  an easy time selling them. Can you
      simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages, or are\n  you trying to search for a needle
      in a haystack?  Since you scored well on this,\n  you probably know the profile
      of your ideal prospect.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499820982468.jpg\\\"\n

      the parade, not behind it. Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year
      life span. You want to be out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it.
      Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n
      \ this happens, prices drop, competition increases, and the market declines.
      These\n  are the markets you not only want to avoid getting into, but want to
      get out of.\n  You always need to be aware of where you are in the product development
      and product\n  life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      you thinking\n  like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you analyzing true, unfiltered
      data that is coming\n  to you, or are you interpreting data to be what you want
      or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n  you blaming your sales people for
      marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you created\n  a definable and repeatable
      sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you in front of the\n  parade or behind
      it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If you are behind the parade, how can you alter\n  the
      customers you sell to, and the product or service mix you offer, so you can\n
      \ get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is your parade coming to an end
      in the\n  foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade to replace this
      one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n  you looked at your existing prospect list and
      performed an in-depth analysis to\n  determine how you find, generate interest
      from, and sell prospects? Have you gone\n  through your prospect list to see
      if you can create a process for finding more of\n  them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Action
      Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>Look into your crystal ball three,\n  four, or five years
      into the future. Don’t look at what the future of your company\n  holds, but
      at the future of your industry, and the general environment your company\n  will
      be operating in. What does this environment look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does\n
      \ the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the local and state economy
      look\n  like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers you sell to look like? Are their
      industries\n  growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What technology trends exist
      in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you take your predictions of the future
      and capitalize on them? These predictions\n  are how you get in front of the
      parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like\n  this in the Business Model
      Secrets course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty\n  customers. How did
      you generate them as prospects? How did you generate interest\n  from them during
      initial conversations? How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic\n  when analyzing
      this. Don’t drink your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want to\n  believe.
      Think exclusively from the customer’s point of view.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324486881300460.jpg\\\"\n
      \ class=\\\"right thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" />Sit down with
      your best salespeople\n  and/or your best former salespeople and pick their
      brains. Get insight into the\n  processes they used. They’ll be inclined to
      tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did\n  it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot;
      This is not true. They used a process.\n  Ask them to describe, in detail, the
      last five big sales they had, step by step,\n  play by play, inch by inch, and
      search for the commonalities. There will be plenty\n  of them. Now take that
      information and create a company-wide, repeatable sales process\n  so you can
      elevate the performance of your average, and not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm\n
      \ what new unserved or underserved markets are going to be upcoming trends in
      your\n  marketplace and get ahead of the competition. If you can, create new
      products and\n  services that will be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n  business owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from\n  Thomas Edison and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas\n  Edison had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he\n  couldn’t
      get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy\n  his
      safety razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted\n
      \ by the marketplace, but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer\n  apathy, he created a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole\n  unit with handle and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw\n  the value and came back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy\n  today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models.\n  In fact, Henry Ford was quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just\n  buy the replacement
      parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a powerful business model can\n  create an
      easier to sell product and reduce reliance on an expensive sales force\n  in
      the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:45:04.216499000Z\nupdated_at:

      your own opinions and biases regarding &quot;what\n  the customer wants, needs
      and desires.&quot; Instead, you are listening to the market.\n  Great job! You
      need to pay attention to market data, not your own subjective opinions.\n  Listening
      to the market instead of listening to yourself is a great tactic to use\n  to
      create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product needs to be sold.
      However,\n  some products need more selling and others need more marketing in
      order to &quot;tee-up&quot;\n  the sale. For instance, insurance tends to be
      sold more than marketed. Toothpaste\n  tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      easiest way to determine whether\n  your product needs to be sold or marketed
      is to do an exercise I call &quot;all\n  or nothing.&quot; Here is an example:
      if you could only sell your product and were\n  allowed NO marketing, what would
      happen? This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials,\n  nothing resembling
      marketing at all. It all goes away. You only have your sales\n  force. However,
      you have the best sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing\n  but superstars.
      What happens to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically\n  or
      slightly?</p>\\r\\n<p>Now flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever,\n
      \ not even bad-sales-people selling. However, the best marketing team in the
      world\n  works with your product. You get all those promotional items that you
      currently\n  don’t have: marketing geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific
      marketing technique\n  you can think of is implemented. What happens? Do sales
      go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n  truth, marketing brings prospects
      to your door. When marketing brings people to\n  you they are sometimes fully
      sold, and sometimes only partially sold. For most businesses,\n  marketing partially
      sells prospects and the sales force needs to do the rest. Answering\n  this
      question can be very challenging. However, it will let you know which is more\n
      \ important for your product or service, marketing or sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many
      times\n  I see business owners who put too much emphasis on selling, when the
      prerequisite\n  to the sale is really the marketing. In this case, marketing
      needs to be effective\n  in order to make the product more saleable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      second component of easy\n  to sell is filling an unserved or underserved market.
      It’s as simple as comparing\n  the demand for the product or service to how
      many vendors are chasing market share.\n  A product is easier to sell in an
      unserved or underserved market. In a crowded market\n  yours ends up being a
      &quot;me too&quot; product, even if it is outstanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ask\n  yourself:
      How would your customers feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If\n  your
      customers would experience a problem filling the need you serve, great! If\n
      \ your answer is closer to, &quot;I don’t think they would have a hard time
      finding\n  another HVAC contractor in Chicago,&quot; then let’s get to work
      and strengthen\n  your value proposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every product or service
      should have a definable\n  and repeatable sales process. Many times we see an
      outstanding salesperson come\n  into an organization and perform their &quot;black
      magic.&quot; No one knows how\n  they sell, they just seem to do it. Perhaps
      we give them more credit than they deserve.\n  Great sales people who move from
      company to company and continue to sell well do\n  so because they are great
      at understanding how to sell products. This does not mean\n  they excel at feature/benefit
      presentations. The secret of great sales people is\n  they are great at creating
      a sales process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many of the truly great sales\n  people do it naturally,
      without knowing how they do it. They create a procedure,\n  a series of steps,
      perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless, which result in\n  a definable
      and repeatable sales process. The goal for every company, if you want\n  a product
      that is easy to sell, is to be able to create a definable and repeatable\n  sales

      \ class=\\\"right\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>There is an
      old saying in business,\n  &quot;Find a parade and get in front of it.&quot;
      Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;\n  product are in front of
      the parade, not behind it. Most products and services only\n  have a 20-year
      life span. You want to be out in front of the growth curve, not chasing\n  it.
      Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market which is maturing. When\n
      \ this happens, prices drop, competition increases, and the market declines.
      These\n  are the markets you not only want to avoid getting into, but want to
      get out of.\n  You always need to be aware of where you are in the product development
      and product\n  life cycles.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are
      you thinking\n  like a customer?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are you analyzing true, unfiltered
      data that is coming\n  to you, or are you interpreting data to be what you want
      or need it to be?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n  you blaming your sales people for
      marketing problems?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How solid is\n  your definable and repeatable
      sales process?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Will you continue to\n  be in front of the parade
      or behind it?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If you are in danger of getting\n  behind the
      parade, how can you alter the customers which you sell to, and the product\n
      \ or service mix you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is\n
      \ your parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a
      new parade\n  to replace this one?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have you looked at your
      existing prospect list\n  and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how
      you find, generate interest\n  from, and sell prospects? Have you gone through
      your prospect list to see if you\n  can create a process for finding more of
      them?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>Look\n  into your crystal
      ball three, four, or five years into the future. Don’t look at\n  what the future
      of your company holds, but at the future of your industry, and the\n  general
      environment your company will be operating in. What does this environment\n
      \ look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What does the general economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      does\n  the local and state economy look like?</p>\\r\\n<p>What do the customers
      you sell\n  to look like? Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      technology\n  trends exist in your industry?</p>\\r\\n<p>How can you take your
      predictions of the\n  future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how
      you get in front of the\n  parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like
      this in the Business Model Secrets\n  course. Take a look at your best ten or
      twenty customers. How did you generate them\n  as prospects? How did you generate
      interest from them during initial conversations?\n  How did you sell them? Be
      very pragmatic when analyzing this. Don’t drink your own\n  Kool-Aid and believe
      what you want to believe. Think exclusively from the customer’s\n  point of
      view.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324486881300460.jpg\\\"\n
      \ class=\\\"right thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" />Sit down with
      your best salespeople\n  and/or your best former salespeople and pick their
      brains. Get insight into the\n  processes they used. They’ll be inclined to
      tell you, &quot;I don’t know how I did\n  it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot;
      This is not true. They used a process.\n  Ask them to describe, in detail, the
      last five big sales they had, step by step,\n  play by play, inch by inch, and
      search for the commonalities. There will be plenty\n  of them. Now take that
      information and create a company-wide, repeatable sales process\n  so you can
      elevate the performance of your average, and not so average, performers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Brainstorm\n
      \ what new unserved or underserved markets are going to be upcoming trends in
      your\n  marketplace and get ahead of the competition. If you can, create new
      products and\n  services that will be easy to sell and have high margins.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>Savvy\n  business owners learn from the masters. They
      know how to take a 100-year-old idea\n  and modify it for today’s market. There
      are two powerful ideas you can borrow from\n  Thomas Edison and King Gillette
      to create a product that is easier to sell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thomas\n  Edison had
      to install electric lights for free in a New York high rise because he\n  couldn’t
      get anyone to try them. Similarly, Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy\n  his
      safety razors. It’s hard to imagine such superior products were not accepted\n
      \ by the marketplace, but it happens all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat
      consumer\n  apathy, he created a massive network of partners to give away his
      razors (the whole\n  unit with handle and blades) for free. Once consumers used
      the product, they saw\n  the value and came back for the high-profit blades.
      Gillette still uses this strategy\n  today.</p>\\r\\n<p>Other companies like
      Jell-O and Ford have used similar models.\n  In fact, Henry Ford was quoted
      as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just\n  buy the replacement
      parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Remember, a powerful business model can\n  create an
      easier to sell product and reduce reliance on an expensive sales force\n  in
      the process.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:57:23.401542000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<h2>You scored low on this aspect.</h2>\\r\\n<p>The four capitals are comprised\n
      \ of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial capital, human capital
      and brand\n  capital. Your score is a composite average of all four areas. We’ll
      run through\n  them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Intellectual Capital</h3>\\r\\n<p>Your
      score indicates\n  you need more intellectual capital. Every business sells
      intellectual property.\n  Intellectual property isn’t just for doctors, patent
      attorneys, accountants and\n  chip designers. Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual
      property, business. If\n  you make widgets, is it the generic making of the
      widgets that generates the profit,\n  probably not? More likely, it is your
      proprietary way of making the widgets, or\n  your secret vendors, or the way
      you train your staff that accounts for the profits.\n  These are all examples
      of intellectual property. The only true asset your business\n  has is the ability
      to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.\n  The little
      secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same\n  ordinary
      thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money\n  is
      you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of your\n
      \ customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things are
      what\n  make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively to
      your bottom\n  line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual\n  capital you will have and the more profit you will
      make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts\n  and connections are intellectual property.
      Look at your Rolodex and figure out what\n  a contact in your Rolodex is worth.
      Some of these contacts are worth quite a bit.\n  Unfortunately, for most of
      us, many of the contacts in a Rolodex cannot be measured\n  in monetary terms.
      These folks may be great friends, great customers, whatever.\n  However, they
      don’t necessarily add to your bottom line. Though these people cannot\n  be
      translated directly into money, they are incredibly valuable to you and your\n
      \ business. If you lose the relationship with them, you can certainly attach
      a negative\n  dollar value on the loss. For instance, what is the value of the
      purchasing agent\n  at your best customer who genuinely likes you? What is the
      value of your old college\n  roommate who calls you once a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;
      but introduces you to\n  some great vendors? What are you doing to nurture and
      grow those relationships?\n  What are you doing to better utilize people who
      could be more helpful to you? There\n  are people that know, like, and trust
      you who may not be adding value to you or\n  your business simply because you
      have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage\n  the long-term relationships
      you have with these people and turn them into a valuable\n  business asset?
      How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex\n  capital
      needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h3>Financial capital.</h3>\\r\\n<p>You’ve heard\n
      \ the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This is
      true\n  not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on
      opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than just
      having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point.  In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored below\n  average, your
      margins may not be funding your growth. This could creating a constantly\n  need
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate\n
      \ amount of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt
      as a\n  weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not,\n  what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer\n  gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot; the business.\n  This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments. He\n  used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things we can do\n  to improve our financial
      capital.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Human Capital</h2>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n
      \ class=\\\"left\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Bill Gates is
      quoted as saying,\n  &quot;Without our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an
      insignificant company.&quot;\n  A great business cannot run without great people
      and your business has been successful\n  attracting and retaining top talent.
      You may have struggled competing with big businesses\n  regarding this. Have
      you figured out a strategy to work without &quot;superstars&quot;\n  yet still
      have a well-running business? This is a &quot;must for many small businesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep\n
      \ in mind that there is an asset, not list on your balance sheet, called human
      capital.\n  This human capital consists of the worker’s knowledge base, their
      abilities, their\n  relationship with customers, and their ability to execute
      your business plan., All\n  these components add up to the intangible value
      of those employees to your business.\n  The more talented and tenured an employee,
      the more valuable he or she is to your\n  business. You have retained your talented
      staff after spending time, energy and\n  effort to teach them the knowledge
      necessary which to be useful to our business.\n  Talent will flow to its highest
      and best use. Continue to carve out areas where\n  talented people’s best &quot;use&quot;
      is working for you.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Brand Capital</h3>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  business-to-business
      enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor\n  &amp; Gambles
      and the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether\n  they
      want one or not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand is\n
      \ what your company &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple. You
      want\n  your brand to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or
      &quot;delivers\n  on time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be
      perceived as, &quot;much\n  more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they
      don’t really care about their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess
      every time we place an order with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES
      mean something to your customers. Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive
      in their eyes. You scored well on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How
      can you make it stronger? Brands typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n
      \ so be careful not to overextend your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n
      \ King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump
      steaks.\n  Instead, create a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets
      inexpensive\n  Chinese-made cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another
      model under the\n  Toyota moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this
      aspect, your job is to protect\n  your current brands and add powerful new ones.
      Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long
      Tail is as markets mature, more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales.
      When markets are new, a handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales.
      However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products
      make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small
      businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on
      the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:
      center;\\\"><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"
      alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\"\n  title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These
      days, with so much global competition\n  and so many options for every customer,
      there is virtually no industry that does\n  not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition crushes margins. Branding\n  to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is a way to battle this. Can\n  market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot;\n  If there
      was market data on some great new niche, it would be obvious to everyone.\n
      \ The only way to create a powerful niche on the long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not\n  a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey guess. You may
      be blindfolded,\n  but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen for tiny
      clues from your customers,\n  vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs
      are latent; they won’t jump up\n  and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a $3 cup of coffee, or a personal\n  computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the idea, despite any data, and created\n  something special. You can do
      the same.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Have\n
      \ you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>How is your
      Rolodex\n  under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What\n

      it?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Action\n  Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think\n  pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my\n  company that is TRULY valuable?&quot;

      3 action steps you can take to augment this intellectual\n  property.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully\n  leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed\n  a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&amp;D, they discovered\n  a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,\n
      \ they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual
      property\n  was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste
      to make it. In\n  the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust.
      California Cedar went\n  to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and
      significantly undercut their\n  sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term
      commitment. California Cedar\n  created a business model where they were paid
      to accept their primary raw material.\n  Now that is leveraging intellectual
      property!</p>\\r\\n<p>Most companies grossly under\n  estimate their intellectual
      capital.During this course, we will work hard to help\n  you discover, and profit
      from, your untapped intellectual capital.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-18 00:44:49.399686000Z\nupdated_at:

      been successful at attracting and retaining\n  top talent. You have done a good
      job competing with big businesses in regard to\n  this. Alternatively, you may
      have figured out a strategy that enables you to work\n  without &quot;superstars,&quot;
      yet still have a well-run business. Keep in mind\n  there is an asset not listed
      on your balance sheet called human capital. This human\n  capital consists of
      workers’ knowledge base, their abilities, their relationships\n  with customers,
      and their ability to execute your business plan. All these components\n  add
      up to the value of these employees to your business. The more talented and tenured\n
      \ an employee, the more valuable he or she is. You have retained your talented
      staff\n  after spending time, energy, and effort to teach them what is necessary
      to be useful\n  to your business. Talent will flow to its highest and best use.
      Continue to carve\n  out areas where talented people’s best use is working for
      you.</p>\\r\\n<h4>Brand\n  Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>Many business-to-business enterprises
      feel that &quot;branding&quot;\n  is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles and the Gillettes
      of the world. Every business\n  has a brand, whether they want one or not. A
      brand does not need to be overly complicated.\n  A brand is what your company
      &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.\n  You want your brand
      to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers\n  on
      time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much\n
      \ more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they don’t really care about
      their\n  customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess every time we place an order
      with them.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  brand DOES mean something to your customers.
      Let’s make sure it means something\n  positive in their eyes. You scored well
      on this aspect, so your brand is strong.\n  How can you make it stronger? Brands
      typically mean one word or phrase to the customer,\n  so be careful not to overextend
      your brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger\n  King underwear, Kellogg’s
      hip-hop street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump steaks.\n  Instead, create
      a new brand or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets inexpensive\n  Chinese-made
      cars under the Scion brand rather than adding another model under the\n  Toyota
      moniker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect\n
      \ your current brands and add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about
      the Long\n  Tail? One of the principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature,
      more and more\n  products make up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a
      handful of products\n  may comprise 80% of the sales. However, as the market
      matures, the &quot;head&quot;\n  or winning products make up only 20% of the
      sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%.\n  Most small businesses can’t compete
      on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place\n  on the Long Tail that we can
      &quot;own.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\\\"\n
      \ alt=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there\n  is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition.
      Excessive competition\n  crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved
      niche on the Long Tail is\n  a way to battle this. Can market research be used
      to find an unserved or underserved\n  niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there
      was market data on some great new niche,\n  it would be obvious to everyone.
      The only way to create a powerful niche on the\n  long tail is to guess a bit.
      Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey\n  guess. You may
      be blindfolded, but you are pointed in the right direction. Listen\n  for tiny
      clues from your customers, vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs\n
      \ are latent; they won’t jump up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM,
      or a\n  $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer, or the internet. Someone believed
      in the\n  idea, despite any data, and created something special. You can do

      ! \"<h2>Congratulations, you scored well on this aspect.</h2>\\r\\n<p>The four\n
      \ capitals are comprised of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial
      capital,\n  human capital and brand capital. Your score is a composite average
      of all four areas.\n  We’ll run through them one by one.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Intellectual
      Capital.</h3>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  high score indicates you have some valuable intellectual
      capital. Every business\n  sells intellectual property. Intellectual property
      isn’t just for doctors, patent\n  attorneys, accountants and chip designers.
      Everyone is in the idea, or intellectual\n  property, business. If you make
      widgets, is it the generic making of the widgets\n  that generates the profit,
      probably not? More likely, it is your proprietary way\n  of making the widgets,
      or your secret vendors, or the way you train your staff that\n  account for
      the profits. These are all examples of intellectual property. The only\n  true
      asset your business has is the ability to generate a profit doing the things\n
      \ you do the way you do them. The little secrets and tricks are what allow you
      to\n  make profits doing the same ordinary thing as the same ordinary company
      next door.\n  The reason you make money is you know a couple of little things
      that enable you\n  to take better care of your customers, buy better, or charge
      a little extra. All\n  the little things are what make up your intellectual
      property and what contribute\n  extensively to your bottom line. Therefore,
      the more you can grow your intellectual\n  property, the more intellectual capital
      you will have and the more profit you will\n  make.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your contacts
      and connections are intellectual property. Look at\n  your Rolodex and figure
      out what a contact in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these\n  contacts are worth
      quite a bit. Unfortunately, for most of us, many of the contacts\n  in a Rolodex
      cannot be measured in monetary terms. These folks may be great friends,\n  great
      customers, whatever. However, they don’t necessarily add to your bottom line.\n
      \ Though these people cannot be translated directly into money, they are incredibly\n
      \ valuable to you and your business. If you lose the relationship with them,
      you can\n  certainly attach a negative dollar value on the loss. For instance,
      what is the\n  value of the purchasing agent at your best customer who genuinely
      likes you? What\n  is the value of your old college roommate who calls you once
      a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot;\n  but introduces you to some great vendors? What
      are you doing to nurture and grow\n  those relationships? What are you doing
      to better utilize people who could be more\n  helpful to you? There are people
      that know, like, and trust you who may not be adding\n  value to you or your
      business simply because you have not asked. Is there a way\n  that you can leverage
      the long-term relationships you have with these people and\n  turn them into
      a valuable business asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex\n  capital?
      What new Rolodex capital needs to be created?</p>\\r\\n<h4>Financial Capital</h4>\\r\\n<p>You’ve\n
      \ heard the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital.
      This is\n  true not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to
      have an appropriate\n  amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize
      on opportunities as\n  they appear. There is more to financial capital than
      just having a big pile of money.\n  For instance, how does your break-even point
      compare to your competition? If you\n  sell your product at the same price and
      at lower margin, you have a higher cost\n  structure and a higher break-even
      point. In this scenario, you would have a financial\n  disadvantage. Conversely,
      if you have a much lower cost structure and/or higher\n  margin than your competition,
      your break-even point would be lower and you would\n  have an advantage in the
      area of financial capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since you scored well,\n  your margins
      should be funding your growth vs. constantly having to borrow money.\n  Debt
      is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate amount of debt for any\n
      \ business or business model. Check out <a href=\\\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\\\">bankabilityindex.com</a>\n
      \ to see if you might be over-leveraged. Continue your financial diligence and
      use\n  debt as a weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong?\n  If not, what can you do with your financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance,\n  a manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to
      &quot;lock up&quot;\n  the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors
      could not afford the consignments.\n  He used the inventory as a weapon to fend
      off competition and retain the customer.\n  Can you simply purchase a weaker
      competitor? Make a list of the things you can do\n  that your financially weaker
      competitors cannot because of their financial status.\n  Consider doing one
      or more of these things to create a competitive &quot;moat&quot;\n  to protect
      you from your competition.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Human Capital</h3>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\\\"\n

      \ an outstanding business model, you must improve your competitive advantage.
      You\n  must also be able to sustain this advantage over the long-term to have
      a stellar\n  business model. Look at AOL, all airlines other than Southwest,
      and Webvan (a former\n  $900MM grocery delivery company) as examples of a good

      class=\\\"right\\\"\n  alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\" /></h3>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The
      Hotel California.</em>\n  Like the song says, &quot;You can check in any time
      you like, but you can never\n  leave.&quot; Cable TV and cell phone companies
      are effective at making it contractually\n  or emotionally difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning
      the standard.</em>\n  Microsoft owns many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office, you may be hurting\n  yourself more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able to share a standardized\n  format document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors. You may not like MS\n  Office, but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it. Many industrial companies\n  besides Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the standard. If you can accomplish\n  this,
      it is difficult or impossible for your customers to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n\n
      \ \\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching cost.</em> Once you have spent a million dollars
      implementing\n  SAP software, you are less likely to switch to a different software
      company because\n  of the cost and headache involved. Find ways to build switching
      cost into your product\n  or service. Switching cost can take the form of dollar
      cost, emotional cost, organizational\n  inertia, or risk, individually or in
      any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low\n  value gained by switching.</em>
      Remember when you could switch long distance companies\n  and cut your bill
      in half? It was a bit of a hassle to switch, but the savings were\n  huge. These
      days, you save virtually nothing by switching long-distance carriers.\n  That’s
      why telemarketers are no longer calling to get you to switch long distance\n
      \ companies. It simply doesn’t result in enough savings for you to go to the
      bother.\n  Keep your pricing and value bundle close to that of your competition
      so the switching\n  cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>
      Nothing says, &quot;You can't\n  quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations can be difficult and sometimes\n  a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want to sell your business someday,\n  get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more accurately determined with\n  a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts with the best vendor\n  terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h3>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h3>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want
      to stock it, there goes 35% of\n  the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Continuous
      R&amp;D needed. Your R&amp;D spending may\n  serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to
      protect you from competitors. If ongoing R&D spending\n  is needed, an under-funded
      competitor will not be able to continue spending after\n  their initial entry
      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex
      or contacts. Your lifelong relationships with people that know, like, and\n
      \ trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Access to capital.
      Sometimes\n  the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>First\n
      \ mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the\n  market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Crest\n
      \ - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty
      synthetic\n  detergent</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery

      service.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n
      \ ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor
      entry\n  barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape.
      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<p>How would you rate your current competitive advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>Will\n
      \ you be able to sustain your competitive advantage? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>What is
      the single\n  most important action you can take to improve your competitive
      advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage?
      Can it be mitigated? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>How\n  can you create customer exit barriers?
      How long would this increase average retention?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  can you
      do to erect a &quot;moat&quot; around your business by creating competitor\n
      \ entry barriers?</p>\\r\\n<p></p>\\r\\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>Write
      down the names\n  of your five best customers. Assume a competitor is aggressively
      targeting those\n  five customers. The competitor will do everything in their
      power to steal those\n  customers from you. What will you do to stop this from
      happening? Pick the top two\n  action items that will aid in retaining each
      customer and do them! If any of these\n  action items are organizational improvements,
      implement them organization-wide.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced\n  Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently\n  enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer.\n  Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone\n
      \ assign someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of
      your competitors\n  if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      powerful\n  technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo
      Hunt&quot; to\n  a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where
      we look long and\n  hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start
      all over again. Not only\n  is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a
      business this way. There are proven\n  methods to move away from the Buffalo
      Hunt and toward a recurring revenue model.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:30:15.833709000Z\nupdated_at:

      class=\\\"right\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\n  /></h3>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>The
      Hotel California.</em> Like the song says,\n  &quot;You can check in any time
      you like, but you can never leave.&quot; Cable TV\n  and cell phone companies
      are effective at making it contractually or emotionally\n  difficult to leave.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Owning
      the standard.</em> Microsoft owns\n  many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office, you may be hurting yourself\n  more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able to share a standardized format\n  document with your colleagues,
      customers, and vendors. You may not like MS Office,\n  but you don’t have any
      choice but to keep buying it. Many industrial companies besides\n  Microsoft
      have been effective at creating the standard. If you can accomplish this,\n
      \ it is difficult or impossible for your customers to buy from someone else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Switching\n
      \ cost.</em> Once you have spent a million dollars implementing SAP software,
      you\n  are less likely to switch to a different software company because of
      the cost and\n  headache involved. Find ways to build switching cost into your
      product or service.\n  Switching cost can take the form of dollar cost, emotional
      cost, organizational\n  inertia, or risk, individually or in any combination.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low\n
      \ value gained by switching.</em> Remember when you could switch long distance
      companies\n  and cut your bill in half? It was a bit of a hassle to switch,
      but the savings were\n  huge. These days, you save virtually nothing by switching
      long-distance carriers.\n  That’s why telemarketers are no longer calling to
      get you to switch long distance\n  companies. It simply doesn’t result in enough
      savings for you to go to the bother.\n  Keep your pricing and value bundle close
      to that of your competition so the switching\n  cost is minimal.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>
      Nothing says, &quot;You can't\n  quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract
      negotiations can be difficult and sometimes\n  a handshake deal is better. However,
      if you want to sell your business someday,\n  get contracts. The value of the
      customer can be more accurately determined with\n  a contract. If you are looking
      for industry-best contracts with the best vendor\n  terms, look at alarm or
      uniform company contracts.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Low-cost\n  provider translated
      to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this strategy\n  to gain
      and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low prices, it\n  is
      hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><em>Integration\n
      \ into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying
      in sales,\n  &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying\n  is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s\n  offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel\n  and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would\n  be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers\n  who design the components they build for the
      automakers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<h3>Competitor\n
      \ Entry Barriers</h3>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Delivery advantages.
      Are you located\n  down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will
      be tough for a competitor\n  to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build
      small plants very close to new\n  automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Controlling
      the\n  distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will\n  be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product
      companies who have\n  successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing
      channel that competitors\n  will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor
      may have a superior product\n  at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want

      into the market.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Size. Some businesses require\n  scale
      that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include automotive, aircraft, ERP\n
      \ software development, and consumer products.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.\n
      \ All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If\n  you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors\n  out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and\n  plumbers.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property,\n  such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors.\n  Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache\n  of obtaining a patent or don’t
      meet patent criteria. This does not mean their value\n  as intellectual property
      is not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola\n  and Colonel Sanders’
      11 Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually\n  greater without
      patents.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Brand capital. Examples: Starbucks or\n  Madonna.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Hard-to-find
      expertise. Limited availability of individuals\n  with a high level of skill
      and/or technical abilities can be an effective entry\n  barrier.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Massive
      marketing expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola\n  and McDonalds spend extraordinary
      sums on marketing. It is virtually impossible\n  to compete with McDonalds since
      McDonald’s spends 9% of its revenues on marketing.\n  A new entry could secure
      market share by outspending McDonalds.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n  Rolodex
      or contacts. Your lifelong relationships with people that know, like, and\n
      \ trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Access to capital.
      Sometimes\n  the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>First\n
      \ mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the\n  market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Crest\n
      \ - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty
      synthetic\n  detergent</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery
      service</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>FedEx\n  - 1st overnight package delivery
      service.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Your\n
      \ ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor
      entry\n  barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape.
      If you are\n  a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business
      to upcoming trends.\n  Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well,
      they guess well. If you\n  can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation.
      If you can see it, so\n  can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small
      competitive advantage is gained\n  from correctly analyzing data. True competitive
      advantage comes from correct predictions.\n  Do this well, and you will always
      be ahead of your competition.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>Watch\n  out
      for typical threats to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded\n
      \ potential competitor poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled\n
      \ by a competitor, or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Points\n
      \ to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<p>Will you be able to sustain your competitive advantage?
      How?</p>\\r\\n<p>Is\n  it possible to improve your competitive advantage? How?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      is the single\n  most important action you can take to improve your competitive
      advantage?</p>\\r\\n<p>What\n  is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage?

      can you do to erect a &quot;moat&quot; around\n  your business by creating competitor
      entry barriers?</p>\\r\\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>Write\n  down the names
      of your five best customers. Assume a competitor is aggressively\n  targeting
      those five customers. The competitor will do everything in their power\n  to
      steal those customers from you. What will you do to stop this from happening?\n
      \ Pick the top two action items that will aid in retaining each customer and
      do them!\n  If any of these action items are organizational improvements, implement
      them organization-wide.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced\n  Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently\n  enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer.\n  Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone\n
      \ assign someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of
      your competitors\n  if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      powerful\n  technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo
      Hunt&quot; to\n  a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where
      we look long and\n  hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start
      all over again. Not only\n  is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a
      business this way. There are proven\n  methods to move away from the Buffalo
      Hunt and toward a recurring revenue model.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:30:15.845582000Z\nupdated_at:

      \ Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In order
      to have a successful\n  business you must build upon quality customers. If you
      have too much churn in your\n  customer base, if your customers cannot pay you,
      or if your customers are so difficult\n  they strain the organization, you do
      not have quality customers. Dealing with low-quality\n  customers will force
      you to devote precious organizational resources to activities\n  that do not
      grow your business. Fortunately, you do not have many of these issues.\n  Your
      focus can move toward adding even higher quality customers and retaining the\n
      \ ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h2>The key considerations on quality customers:</h2>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are\n
      \ our customers overly price conscious? If customers have their eye on nothing
      but\n  price, it’s very difficult for most businesses to remain profitable.
      Ideally, what\n  needs to be done is to find the customers who are going to
      attribute value to something,\n  other than sales price. If that cannot be accomplished,
      you are selling a product\n  which the customer perceives as somewhat generic.
      You need to work on your brand\n  to overcome this. Branding can allow you to
      attack a different segment of the marketplace,\n  and charge a premium for some
      attribute other than the generic product. This attribute\n  does not need to
      be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences. For example,\n  all
      the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and\n
      \ a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In\n
      \ every business relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate\n
      \ terms.&quot; Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate\n
      \ many of the business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics\n
      \ in the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies,
      these\n  seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance,\n  many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web
      to &quot;force&quot;\n  customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating\n  terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this
      is a minor &quot;term&quot;\n  to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor\n  dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same\n  way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business\n  stories about vendors that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies\n  like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers\n  are not quality customers because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A\n  quality customer
      isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently\n
      \ provides many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers,\n  sometimes they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration\n  of quality customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime\n  value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are\n  in a business with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a\n  new customer is $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell,\n  on average, $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend\n  half the lifetime value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario,\n  the cost of attraction
      vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer\n  is horrible. To
      improve this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower\n  the cost
      of acquiring the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There\n
      \ are several questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><img\n

      alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\n  />What is difficult about attracting customers?
      Attracting customers is difficult\n  for every business. I used to say, &quot;Listen,
      we aren’t opening a Cheesecake\n  Factory here.&quot; I said this because when
      the Cheesecake Factory opened in my\n  hometown, the lines were incredibly long,
      even during non-peak times. They had two-hour\n  waits at 2pm on a Tuesday.
      Then, a funny thing happened. I stood in that line with\n  a guy who told me
      that his brother worked in business development for the Cheesecake\n  Factory.
      He related that they sent his brother to a new location one year ahead\n  of
      the store opening to develop trade accounts, talk up the opening, etc. The moral\n
      \ of this story is, even the businesses that are seemingly &quot;beating away
      customers&quot;\n  have worked hard to get them.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Do
      you know the easy places to find\n  customers? Are you paying expensive sales
      people to sell the product rather than\n  using inexpensive marketing? Are you
      over-marketing when the product simply needs\n  to be sold? Do you need a branding
      makeover because your brand lacks meaning to\n  the customer? Are you compensating
      for your weak brand through other methodologies,\n  such as lowering your price
      or putting extra emphasis on the sales function?</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>How\n
      \ long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job
      for their\n  customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t
      enough to just\n  do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you
      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h2>Points\n
      \ to Consider </h2>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for
      customer\n  acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What does it cost
      your competitors\n  to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What’s
      your\n  competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer
      than your competitors?\n  Why?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Are your customers more price
      sensitive than those of your competitors?\n  If you have excessively price-conscious
      customers, do you have the opportunity to\n  switch these customers for better
      ones? Who are those better customers? Do you have\n  the opportunity to adjust
      the verticals you operate in to attract less price-conscious\n  customers? Do
      you have any customers on the books that were purposely forfeited\n  by your
      competitors? If so why?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>Run\n
      \ a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached spreadsheet:</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1325876401721778.png\\\" alt=\\\"Customer Profitability\n
      \ Analysis\\\" title=\\\"Customer Profitability Analysis\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Rank
      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have. Do they demand excessive\n  discounts even though they pay
      net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated\n  with carrying their accounts
      receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time\n  or C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis\n  is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they\n  thought was their
      fourth best is actually their best customer and the one they thought\n  was
      their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult\n
      \ decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some
      customers\n  tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more
      money by not selling\n  to them. This is always a difficult realization because
      most business owners are\n  programmed to think that there is no such thing
      as a bad customer, and that anyone\n  who gives you money is a good customer.
      This is usually true. But occasionally,\n  it can be false. I encourage you
      to do a customer analysis annually to see what\n  the true margin provided by
      each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>In\n  the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price\n  consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never\n  about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to\n  pay a
      certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features\n
      \ and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s
      add\n  value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly
      while providing\n  better value to the customer. This extra value may be in
      the form of a new or modified\n  product. For instance, make a premium version
      of your product. Figure out how to\n  add features, benefits, and attributes
      and see if that product will command a higher\n  price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate\n  ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years\n  ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market.\n
      \ These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice
      cream\n  became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never
      know what is\n  going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who
      would have figured\n  that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market
      when you can get a similar\n  cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\\r\\n\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-17 23:37:57.774600000Z\nupdated_at:

      you know the easy places to find\n  customers? Are you paying expensive sales
      people to sell the product rather than\n  using inexpensive marketing? Are you
      over-marketing when the product simply needs\n  to be sold? Do you need a branding
      makeover because your brand lacks meaning to\n  the customer? Are you compensating

      can employ that will\n  allow you to retain your customers longer than you would
      by just doing a good job.\n  This does not mean over-managing retention will
      cover up lousy work.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Create\n  a spreadsheet of your
      top five customers. How long does an average customer stay\n  with your business?
      Probably several years. Imagine you keep a customer 4 years.\n  What is the
      lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years retention\n  vs.
      4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You need 25% less\n
      \ sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace the customer
      for\n  an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies having
      a great\n  customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds of
      thousands of dollars\n  to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like\n  to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be
      pragmatic. By retaining them for\n  10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact
      on your business will be astronomical.\n  The hardest customer to acquire is
      the new one. By reducing the sales effort by\n  25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire
      customer with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ol>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h2>Points\n

      your customers\n  by sales in descending order putting the best customer first
      and the worst customer\n  last in order of sales. Include several other criteria,
      including subjective definitions\n  like how difficult they are to deal with,
      how do they tax the organization, what’s\n  their sales growth, and what additional
      demands they have.</p>\\r\\n<p>Do they demand\n  excessive discounts even though
      they pay net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital\n  associated with carrying
      their accounts receivable balance versus a customer that\n  pays on time or
      C.O.D.?</p>\\r\\n<p>What you will find after running this customer\n  cost analysis
      is the customer rankings will change. Many people find out that the\n  customer
      they thought was their fourth best is actually their best customer, and\n  the
      one they thought was their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead\n
      \ you to some difficult decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers.
      You\n  may find that some customers tax the organization to such an extent that
      you will\n  make more money by not selling to them. This is always a difficult
      realization because\n  most business owners are programmed to think that there
      is no such thing as a bad\n  customer, and that anyone who gives you money is
      a good customer. This is usually\n  true. But occasionally, it can be false.
      I encourage you to do a customer analysis\n  annually to see what is the true
      margin provided by each customer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced\n  Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we determine the extent\n  of your customers’
      price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot;\n  it’s
      almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer\n
      \ is only going to pay a certain amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based
      upon\n  the value of features and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather
      than just lowering\n  price, let’s add value instead. This can be a great way
      to increase the price slightly\n  while providing better value to the customer.
      This extra value may be in the form\n  of a new or modified product. For instance,
      make a premium version of your product.\n  Figure out how to add features, benefits,
      and attributes and see if that product\n  will command a higher price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular\n  ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream
      in half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream\n  market twenty years ago.
      Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny\n  segment of the market.
      These were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before\n  long, premium ice
      cream became a very large segment of the total ice cream market.\n  You never
      know what is going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode.\n  Who
      would have figured that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market\n
      \ when you can get a similar cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for
      a buck?</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2011-11-21 21:34:15.717899000Z\nupdated_at: 2012-01-16

      \ Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In order
      to have a successful\n  business you must build upon quality customers. If you
      have too much churn in your\n  customer base, if your customers cannot pay you,
      or if your customers are so difficult\n  they strain the organization, you do
      not have quality customers. Dealing with low-quality\n  customers will force
      you to devote precious organizational resources to activities\n  that do not
      grow your business. Fortunately, you do not have many of these issues.\n  Your
      focus can move toward adding even higher quality customers and retaining the\n
      \ ones you have.</p>\\r\\n<h2>The key considerations on quality customers:</h2>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even\n
      \ though you have quality customers, are they still price conscious? If customers\n
      \ have their eye on nothing but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to\n  remain profitable. Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers
      who are\n  going to attribute value to something, other than sales price. If
      that cannot be\n  accomplished, you are selling a product which the customer
      perceives as somewhat\n  generic. You need to work on your brand to overcome
      this. Branding can allow you\n  to attack a different segment of the marketplace,
      and charge a premium for some\n  attribute other than the generic product. This
      attribute does not need to be significant.\n  Many brands have only subtle differences.
      For example, all the variations of toothpaste\n  are basically the same. You
      squeeze a tube and a paste comes out. However, dozens\n  of successful brands
      exist in this market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>In every business\n  relationship,
      one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate terms.&quot;\n  Can
      you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate many of the business\n
      \ terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics in the business
      relationship.\n  If not, you have a problem. For many companies, these seemingly
      insignificant terms\n  add up to a large portion of their profits. For instance,
      many companies have used\n  the self-service aspect of the web to &quot;force&quot;
      customers to be their own\n  customer service rep or troubleshooter. They are
      dictating terms and dramatically\n  lowering costs. Typically, this is a minor
      &quot;term&quot; to the customer, so\n  they give in and self service.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A
      small vendor dealing with Wal-Mart\n  or Starbucks may not be able to dictate
      terms in the same way as they can with a\n  smaller customer. In fact, you may
      have heard some business stories about vendors\n  that have specifically chosen
      not do business with companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks\n  for this very reason.
      In their opinion, these large customers are not quality customers\n  because
      all the terms are dictated by the goliath.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>A quality customer\n
      \ isn’t always a large customer. A quality customer is one that consistently
      provides\n  many dollars of margin to your business. Sometimes they are large
      customers, sometimes\n  they are not.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>The
      third consideration of quality\n  customers is having a low cost to attract
      them compared to their lifetime value,\n  i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime
      revenue or margin. Imagine you are in a business\n  with a 2-year sales cycle.
      Let’s say that the cost of acquiring a new customer is\n  $25,000. If your average
      customer stays only 6 months, and you sell, on average,\n  $100,000 of product
      at a 50 % margin during that time, you will spend half the lifetime\n  value
      of the customer finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction\n
      \ vs. lifetime dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To
      improve\n  this, you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost
      of acquiring\n  the customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<p>There
      are several\n  questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\\r\\n\\t\\t<ol>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><img\n

      Attracting customers is difficult\n  for every business. I used to say, &quot;Listen,
      we aren’t opening a Cheesecake\n  Factory here.&quot; I said this because when
      the Cheesecake Factory opened in my\n  hometown, the lines were incredibly long,
      even during non-peak times. They had two-hour\n  waits at 2pm on a Tuesday.
      Then, a funny thing happened. I stood in that line with\n  a guy who told me
      that his brother worked in business development for the Cheesecake\n  Factory.
      He related that they sent his brother to a new location one year ahead\n  of
      the store opening to develop trade accounts, talk up the opening, etc. The moral\n

      \ live in the Midwest where there are many ethanol refineries. They came into
      existence\n  at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars each. Then, the price
      of oil dropped\n  dramatically and this industry became nonviable without additional
      government subsidies.\n  These subsidies never did occur and many of these ethanol
      plants are being shut\n  down before ever coming online. The longevity of the
      industry was not sustainable\n  without the high price of oil.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your
      industry may not be around for a long\n  time. I am not advocating changing
      the business you are in. Once you are in a certain\n  business, you are stuck,
      right? That is partially true, but not entirely. For example,\n  think about
      IBM. How do you define their business? If you define their business\n  as a
      provider of equipment and automation for office workers, their business hasn’t\n
      \ changed much over the years. But when you remember that IBM started in office
      machines,\n  then typewriters, then computers, and then service delivery, they
      have done an excellent\n  job of morphing their business model over the years.
      They were constantly shifting\n  into industries and sub-businesses that were
      growing.</p>\\r\\n<p>All businesses can\n  do this if they are open to change.
      It begins with subtly changing the SIC code\n  of the industry you are in. In
      the 1850s people traveled cross country via railroad.\n  Railroads were the
      people movers. Then in the 1920s and 1930s the airline industry\n  was beginning
      and the railroads saw themselves as a railroad and not a people mover.\n  The
      railroads were flush with lots of cash but did nothing to expand into the airline\n
      \ industry because in their minds, they were a railroad. If the railroads had
      seen\n  themselves as a people-moving business, they would have jumped into
      the airline\n  business, or perhaps even the automotive industry.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since
      you scored below\n  average, there are some concerns as to the long-term viability
      of your industry.\n  Ask yourself, &quot;Are you really an IT services company
      or do you help companies\n  improve their business process through the use of
      technology?&quot; Do you see yourself\n  as a gadget seller or do you solve
      a broader customer issue? The issue never changes,\n  just what you sell the
      customer. There’s a bigger picture for everything you do.\n  You are always
      solving a problem for your customers. What you currently do is specifically\n
      \ how you solve their problem. However, these specifics can change over time.
      Your\n  opportunities lie in expanding your products or services in this strong
      industry.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Points\n  to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<p>Picture it is ten
      years from now and you are looking into\n  your crystal ball. What does the
      longevity of your business look like in ten years?\n  What is the future environment
      like? Is it better than today, or is it worse? How\n  about twenty years from
      now? Do you still see growth and opportunity in your business?\n  If so, you
      are in great shape. If you have some doubts, analyze things from the\n  worst-case
      perspective. What happens if things play out closer to the worst-case\n  scenario
      rather than your expected or hopeful scenario? Can you mitigate or eliminate\n

      \ owners have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their working
      lives\n  are spent in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs to be
      a significant\n  asset for you and your family. I believe every business owner
      should be able to\n  sell their business for a financially meaningful sum.  That
      sum is to be defined\n  by you. It needs to be enough so you will never need
      to work again if you do not\n  want to. Let’s say the amount is $50 million.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      you put your business\n  up for sale today, could you sell it for that? Most
      business owners think their\n  businesses are worth more than they actually
      are. Here is an exercise I suggest\n  you do.</p>\\r\\n<p>Imagine I work for
      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50\n  million to buy businesses.
      You and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business\n  right now. I’m going
      to pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business\n  for, $5
      million, $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank.\n
      \ You have a party; you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n
      \ src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074470197223.jpg\\\" class=\\\"right\\\"
      alt=\\\"Business\n  Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" />The
      CEO Emeritus never needs to\n  sell his/her business. The CEO Emeritus creates
      a business that runs very well without\n  their direct daily input. The CEO
      Emeritus works the hours that she wants to work,\n  gets paid a terrific salary
      (what you earn right now or maybe more), does work that\n  she wants to do,
      and performs activities only an owner can; like being the head\n  cheerleader,
      the visionary, the strategist, the keeper of key customer relationships,\n  and
      the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus Activities &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot;\n
      \ Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers The 16 Hats Strategy in
      detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n  instance, the Standard Bearer is the person that
      maintains the level of how well\n  the organization performs all work. Have
      you ever noticed your business runs better\n  when you are in the building versus
      when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer\n  dynamic at work. It’s not that
      you are doing anything; it’s just running better\n  because you are present.
      Your people know the standard is higher when you are in\n  the building. Bearing
      the standard is an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The 16 Hats\n  activities pay
      exceptionally well, hundreds or thousands of dollars per hour, and\n  they don’t
      take much time. The reason is that the true value of the CEO is these\n  infrequent,
      high-value activities which only the CEO can perform. The CEO Emeritus\n  that
      does a few high-value, low-frequency activities and can draw a terrific amount\n
      \ of money out of the business without investing tremendous amounts of time.
      I encourage\n  you to consider the option of becoming the CEO Emeritus vs. selling
      your business.\n  For most business owners, it is more financially viable to
      become a CEO Emeritus\n  than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<p>Is
      your business truly\n  saleable for top dollar? Many small businesses sell for
      three to five times their\n  earnings. If you are in one of these businesses
      it makes a lot more sense to create\n  a CEO Emeritus situation. You can take
      your earnings in perpetuity rather than cashing\n  out for three years’ worth
      of earnings. This creates a question: In order to create\n  an exit strategy,
      is your business better situated for you to sell it or for you\n  to become
      the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some work to do to maximize\n  the
      value of their business. Whether you are working to maximize the value of the\n
      \ business for sale to an outside party, or working to maximize the value of
      the income\n  stream for yourself, many of the activities overlap. However,
      if you create a business\n  you can run as a CEO Emeritus, you will have created
      a far more saleable business\n  that will command a much higher price-to-earnings
      multiple. Therefore, I recommend\n  working towards CEO Emeritus status. There
      is no downside. If you sell your business,\n  it will sell for much more once
      you are CEO Emeritus. If you decide not to sell,\n  you have all the benefits
      of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What systems or processes\n  are lacking
      in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO Emeritus? The simplest\n  way
      to find out is to physically remove yourself from the business premises and\n
      \ figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there. These issues are the first
      systems\n  that need to be tightened up. Do you have the proper people in place
      for you to\n  assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or do you have some holes on
      your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  issue is never as simple as &quot;the people,&quot;
      it’s almost always a system\n  issue instead. Systems are much easier to control
      than people, so I encourage you\n  to start with the systems instead of the
      people. I think you will find your people\n  will get better as a result of
      working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times we are\n  missing a key player
      on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO Emeritus role.\n  What role
      would this person fill? How much will you need to pay them? Is your need\n  for
      control holding you back from assuming the CEO Emeritus role? Is your need to\n
      \ be involved in all the daily nitty gritty holding you back from building a
      great\n  business that will allow you to become a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h2>Action
      Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>What\n  does a business just like yours that will sell for
      $20 million look like? How much\n  money does that business make? What activities
      does that CEO do every day, week,\n  and month to enable that business to be
      worth $20 million? What are the differences\n  between that business and yours?
      Write down five things that need to happen in order\n  for you to move closer
      to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get to work on one or two\n  of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will
      your business model enable you make your business’ worth\n  to $20 million?
      You may be well on your way to a $20 million check, so keep it up.\n  Working
      toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a safe way to not only build a great business,\n

      number one and number two of the &quot;A&quot; categories\n  (excellent margins

      Your business\n  is worth what someone will pay for it. The valuation is just
      a number on paper.\n  I have seen people pay too much for businesses, and I
      have seen people get very\n  upset when an assessment says their business is
      worth a low sum. In most cases,\n  I don’t recommend spending five or ten thousand
      dollars to get a formal appraisal\n  of your business. However, it’s a good
      exercise to go to a business broker and talk\n  to someone who buys and sells
      businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable\n  your business is. They

      assessment on the value of your business.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced\n  Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively\n  on the techniques
      needed to become a CEO Emeritus. Once you have achieved Emeritus\n  status,
      you might not want to sell your business. In our opinion, CEO Emeritus is\n
      \ the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge with clients is getting
      them to\n  believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week and make more
      than they are\n  making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be used for
      a graceful exit is a\n  plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror stories
      about someone who bought\n  a business and it went badly. Bad purchases done
      poorly go badly. In the Business\n  Model Secrets program, we will discuss criteria
      for a good plug-in acquisition that\n  could catapult you to the next level.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      \ have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their working lives

      you put your business up for sale today,\n  could you sell it for that? Most
      business owners think their businesses are worth\n  more than they actually
      are. Here is an exercise I suggest you do.</p>\\r\\n<p>Imagine\n  I work for
      a venture capital firm in Chicago. I have $50 million to buy businesses.\n  You
      and I work a deal and I’m going to buy your business right now. I’m going to\n
      \ pay you with a cashier’s check. How much can I buy the business for, $5 million,\n
      \ $20 million? It is now tomorrow and you take my check to the bank. You have
      a party;\n  you celebrate. I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>Hey,\n
      \ we were excited about buying your business and taking it to the next level.
      This\n  was an exciting opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is
      the management\n  team we had in place to take over the business fell apart.
      We are not going to be\n  able to successfully implement the objectives we had
      for the business and it doesn’t\n  make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t
      expect you rip up the check, but I would\n  like you to buy the business back.
      How much will you buy the business back for?\n  Two million dollars? Five million
      dollars? My guess is that you will buy the business\n  back for significantly
      less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Bottom\n  line: your
      business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want me to\n  pay
      you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there between\n
      \ what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy it for?</p>\\r\\n<p>I\n
      \ travel the country talking to business owners and have heard some funny answers\n
      \ to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal is a deal&quot; when
      I\n  ask what they will buy back their business for. Most times, the buyback
      price is\n  3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However, at least we have
      a starting point.\n  We have some work to do to get your business to be worth
      the bigger number. We will\n  get the business to be worth the bigger number
      through business model modifications.\n  The single best way to create a valuable
      business is to have a fantastic business\n  model which is well implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business\n  owners don’t have much of one. They
      plan on continuing to work hard and build their\n  business. These are good
      things. Someday they plan on selling their business, and\n  their hope is somebody
      will walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed\n  working with several
      clients who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting\n  when this
      happens. However, this does not happen for most business owners because\n  they
      lack a viable exit strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy,\n
      \ but I have a better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\\r\\n<p><img\n

      alt=\\\"Business\n  Model Survey\\\" title=\\\"Business Model Survey\\\" />The
      CEO Emeritus never needs to\n  sell his/her business. The CEO Emeritus creates
      a business that runs very well without\n  their direct daily input. The CEO
      Emeritus works the hours that she wants to work,\n  gets paid a terrific salary
      (what you earn right now or maybe more), does work that\n  she wants to do,
      and performs activities only an owner can; like being the head\n  cheerleader,
      the visionary, the strategist, the keeper of key customer relationships,\n  and
      the standard bearer. We call the CEO Emeritus Activities &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot;\n
      \ Our Business Model Secrets Advanced Course covers The 16 Hats Strategy in
      detail.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n  instance, the Standard Bearer is the person that
      maintains the level of how well\n  the organization performs all work. Have
      you ever noticed your business runs better\n  when you are in the building versus
      when you are not? That’s the Standard Bearer\n  dynamic at work. It’s not that
      you are doing anything; it’s just running better\n  because you are present.
      Your people know the standard is higher when you are in\n  the building. Bearing
      the standard is an activity.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of The 16 Hats\n  activities pay
      exceptionally well, hundreds or thousands of dollars per hour, and\n  they don’t
      take much time. The reason is that the true value of the CEO is these\n  infrequent,
      high-value activities which only the CEO can perform. The CEO Emeritus\n  that
      does a few high-value, low-frequency activities and can draw a terrific amount\n
      \ of money out of the business without investing tremendous amounts of time.
      I encourage\n  you to consider the option of becoming the CEO Emeritus vs. selling
      your business.\n  For most business owners, it is more financially viable to
      become a CEO Emeritus\n  than it is to sell.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\\r\\n<p>Is
      your business truly\n  saleable for top dollar? Many small businesses sell for
      three to five times their\n  earnings. If you are in one of these businesses
      it makes a lot more sense to create\n  a CEO Emeritus situation. You can take
      your earnings in perpetuity rather than cashing\n  out for three years’ worth
      of earnings. This creates a question: In order to create\n  an exit strategy,
      is your business better situated for you to sell it or for you\n  to become
      the CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<p>Every CEO has some work to do to maximize\n  the
      value of their business. Whether you are working to maximize the value of the\n
      \ business for sale to an outside party, or working to maximize the value of
      the income\n  stream for yourself, many of the activities overlap. However,
      if you create a business\n  you can run as a CEO Emeritus, you will have created
      a far more saleable business\n  that will command a much higher price-to-earnings
      multiple. Therefore, I recommend\n  working towards CEO Emeritus status. There
      is no downside. If you sell your business,\n  it will sell for much more once
      you are CEO Emeritus. If you decide not to sell,\n  you have all the benefits
      of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\\r\\n<p>What systems or processes\n  are lacking
      in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO Emeritus? The simplest\n  way
      to find out is to physically remove yourself from the business premises and\n
      \ figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there. These issues are the first
      systems\n  that need to be tightened up. Do you have the proper people in place
      for you to\n  assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or do you have some holes on
      your team?</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n  issue is never as simple as &quot;the people,&quot;
      it’s almost always a system\n  issue instead. Systems are much easier to control
      than people, so I encourage you\n  to start with the systems instead of the
      people. I think you will find your people\n  will get better as a result of
      working on the systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many times we are\n  missing a key player
      on our team who will enable us to assume the CEO Emeritus role.\n  What role
      would this person fill? How much will you need to pay them? Is your need\n  for
      control holding you back from assuming the CEO Emeritus role? Is your need to\n
      \ be involved in all the daily nitty gritty holding you back from building a
      great\n  business that will allow you to become a CEO Emeritus?</p>\\r\\n<h2>Action
      Steps</h2>\\r\\n<p>What\n  does a business just like yours that will sell for
      $20 million look like? How much\n  money does that business make? What activities
      does that CEO do every day, week,\n  and month to enable that business to be
      worth $20 million? What are the differences\n  between that business and yours?
      Write down five things that need to happen in order\n  for you to move closer
      to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get to work on one or two\n  of them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Will
      your business model enable you make your business’ worth\n  to $20 million?
      You may be well on your way to a $20 million check, so keep it up.\n  Working

      and easy to sell) of Business Model Secrets. If you have excellent\n  margins
      and a product that’s easy to sell, you are well on your way to creating\n  a
      powerful business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are serious about selling your business\n
      \ in the next two or three years, visit a business broker. I don’t recommend
      you pay\n  a lot of money for a business assessment; it’s completely subjective.
      Your business\n  is worth what someone will pay for it. The valuation is just
      a number on paper.\n  I have seen people pay too much for businesses, and I
      have seen people get very\n  upset when an assessment says their business is
      worth a low sum. In most cases,\n  I don’t recommend spending five or ten thousand
      dollars to get a formal appraisal\n  of your business. However, it’s a good
      exercise to go to a business broker and talk\n  to someone who buys and sells
      businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable\n  your business is. They
      may have some tips to get your business more saleable and\n  get a fair market
      assessment on the value of your business.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced\n  Techniques</h2>\\r\\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively\n  on the techniques
      needed to become a CEO Emeritus. Once you have achieved Emeritus\n  status,
      you might not want to sell your business. In our opinion, CEO Emeritus is\n
      \ the most graceful of exits. Our biggest challenge with clients is getting
      them to\n  believe that it IS possible to work 10 hours a week and make more
      than they are\n  making now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another tactic which can be used for
      a graceful exit is a\n  plug-in acquisition. Many CEOs have heard horror stories
      about someone who bought\n  a business and it went badly. Bad purchases done
      poorly go badly. In the Business\n  Model Secrets program, we will discuss criteria
      for a good plug-in acquisition that\n  could catapult you to the next level.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      than a lawsuit filed every\n  month for several million dollars. Even if Taser
      wins most of these lawsuits, which\n  they do, they still have an incredible
      legal bill. Taser has to budget for this\n  legal bill and it eats into their
      profits substantially. It doesn’t matter if they\n  win or lose; they are going
      to get sued regularly. Does your business have a similar\n  issue? Are you going

      business model is the proprietary\n  methodology used to acquire, service, and
      retain customers.&quot; &mdash; Jim Muehlhausen,\n  Author &quot;The 51 Fatal
      Business Errors and How to Avoid Them&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>Your\n  business model
      is your secret sauce. Your model is what makes your business unique.\n  Your
      business model is the formula you use to outsmart your competitors, provide\n
      \ ongoing value to customers, and continually grow your business. There are
      eight\n  essential areas to a business model:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      have excellent margins</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n  be easy to sell</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must
      have The Four Capitals&copy;: Intellectual Capital,\n  Financial Capital, Human
      Capital and Brand Capital</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must be able to\n  maintain ongoing
      competitive advantage</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must have quality customers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must\n
      \ have longevity of the industry</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must provide for the owner’s
      graceful\n  exit</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must avoid pitfalls</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Not
      all the areas carry\n  an equal weight. As you can see from the graph of the
      section weighs below, the\n  combination of excellent margins plus an easy to
      sell product account for over one\n  half of the total score. Significant research
      has gone into this scoring process\n  to assess your business model with the
      greatest accuracy. Remember that your competitors\n  are actively working to
      improve there competitive position and therefore business\n  models erode over
      time. No matter what your score, your best source of competitive\n  advantage
      is to be continually actively working to refine and improve your business\n
      \ model.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1323378575149393.jpg\\\"
      alt=\\\"The\n  Ideal Business Model\\\" title=\\\"The Ideal Business Model\\\"
      /></p>\\r\\n<p>In the past,\n  you may not have given much thought to your business
      model. Most business books\n  teach us that our business plan is the most important
      tool for managing our business\n  success. However, a stellar business plan
      is not much good without a solid business\n  model behind it.</p>\\r\\n<div
      style=\\\"color: #177cbf; font-weight: bold; font-style:\n  italic; text-align:
      center;\\\">Great business plan + bad business model = a bad business</div>\\r\\n<div\n
      \ style=\\\"color: #177cbf; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-align:
      center;\\\">Average\n  business plan + great business model = a great business</div>\\r\\n<p>Previously,\n
      \ there were no objective criteria for gauging the quality of a business model.
      Venture\n  capitalists and bankers had been judging business models for years,
      but on subjective,\n  gut impressions. Our model uses a scientific, objective
      approach to grading an existing\n  business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are still
      not sold on the importance of your business\n  model, ponder this: all business
      models will go stale if unaltered. Typically, this\n  process takes ten to twenty
      years. Here are some examples:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockbuster\n  video
      made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in the 1990’s and commanded\n
      \ a 90% market share. Today it is nearly defunct.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IBM has successfully\n
      \ morphed its business model several times over the years in order to remain
      successful\n  vs. Xerox and Kodak who have not.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Radio stations
      were a profitable\n  cash cow for decades until iPods came along.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If
      you were Wal-Mart\n  in the 1990s, would you have figured that your biggest
      competitor would be Amazon.com?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>For\n  many retailers, the
      tried and true Yellow Pages method of customer attraction has\n  stopped working.
      Successful retailers have changed their client attraction model\n  to continue
      their success.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>This Business Model Evaluator Report\n
      \ below has several specific suggestions how to innovate biz model. Work with
      your\n  consulting partner to implement these solutions and watch your business
      grow.</p>\"\nid: 1\n"

      \ practices</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Best practice #1: Overspending beats under spending.</h3>\\r\\n<p>Your\n
      \ website is a good-looking front door to your company. Whether you get a lot
      of traffic\n  or not, your website helps you gain customers. If even a portion
      of your website\n  is unprofessional or unattractive, a prospect surfing your
      website could say, &quot;these\n  guys don’t look that professional.&quot; If
      so, the prospect may excuse you from\n  the buying process before you even have
      a shot.</p>\\r\\n<p>Better to spend a few\n  thousand dollars too much for your
      website than to lose prospects.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Best\n  practice #2: White Sells
      Version 2.0</h3>\\r\\n<p>The old saying in advertising was\n  &quot;white sells.&quot;
      The point was that too much copy cluttered the message\n  and actually hurt
      selling. On the web the same is true; too much text hurts sales.\n  However,
      on the web, substitute pictures, graphics and video for white.</p>\\r\\n<p>Whenever\n
      \ possible, use video or pictures instead of words. In our time-starved world,
      no\n  one reads anymore.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Best practice #3: Free beats cheap...
      by a lot!</h3>\\r\\n<p>In\n  his book <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Free:
      The Future of Radical\n  Price</span>, author Chris Anderson (<span style=\\\"text-decoration:
      underline;\\\">The\n  Long Tail</span>) performs a study on the power of free.
      Here’s the experiment:</p>\\r\\n<p>Test\n  1: A large group of people is offered
      a Hersey’s Kiss (fair market value $0.15)\n  for a penny or a chocolate truffle
      (fair market value $1) for $0.15. Results: Over\n  70% of the participants choose
      the $0.15 underpriced truffle.</p>\\r\\n<p>Test 2:\n  The price of each chocolate
      is dropped one cent. The same group is offered the Kiss\n  for free and the
      truffle for $0.14. The results flipped: 70+ percent now chose the\n  Kiss. That’s
      the power of free!</p>\\r\\n<h3>Best practice #4: $50 worth of free</h3>\\r\\n<p>Internet\n
      \ gurus recommend that your free item have a perceived value of $50. Right now
      you\n  are probably saying, &quot;What?&quot; Don’t panic, it is perceived value,
      not cost\n  or sales price.</p>\\r\\n<p>Examples of high value free items include:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>White\n
      \ papers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Special reports</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Video Tutorials</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Insider\n
      \ tips newsletter</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Conference admission</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>One-on-one
      consultation</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Assessment\n  or quiz (robust enough to be valued
      at $50)</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Webinar (live or replay)</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Useful\n
      \ template or form</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>These free items are typically called
      &quot;squeeze\n  items.&quot; The object is to offer something valuable enough
      to squeeze the email\n  address from the prospect. It takes a $50 item to get
      most people’s email.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Best\n  practice #5: Bust freeloading cheaters</h3>\\r\\n<p>You
      have worked hard to create\n  a high-value free squeeze item. You nicely request
      the prospect’s information only\n  to receive a@a.com or none@atyourbusiness.com.
      If you allow the user to type anything\n  into your contact form and then be
      linked to the goodies, you will be sorry.</p>\\r\\n<p>Instead,\n  email the
      item to the same email which the user inputs into your contact form. This\n
      \ is not difficult for programmers and it will cut your bad leads to zero.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      \ or Upgrade your social media presence. If you do not have a Twitter page,
      LinkedIn\n  page, or Facebook page, create them. If you are starting at point
      zero, here are\n  some options:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Hire a social media
      professional to create your\n  pages and profiles. This should cost under $1000
      for most companies.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Do\n  it yourself. Even if you are not
      a computer pro, you should be able to set up these\n  pages with the help of
      online tools or a few good Google searches. In 5-10 hours\n  you can have all
      your pages complete and will have learned much about social media.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Find\n
      \ a partner. Misery loves company. If you are finding yourself dreading this
      task,\n  then find a partner. Buddy up with either someone more advanced or
      someone in the\n  same boat. It doesn’t matter. Meetup groups could be a good
      place to connect with\n  someone.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>If you have a Twitter
      page, you can improve it by:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>When\n  you read an online
      article that could interest your prospects, tweet it</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tUse\n
      \ a custom background rather than the generic ones provided. There are many
      free options.\n  Just Google &quot;Free twitter background.&quot; If you really

      to get followed. A\n  common practice is to find people you would like to follow
      you and follow them first.\n  Typically, 20% will follow you back.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Decide
      if you need guru status.\n  Gurus have thousands of followers and only follow
      a few people. Typically, these\n  people are celebrities, public figures, or
      well-regarded experts. It is quite difficult\n  to build 10,000 followers without
      following back. If you will follow others back\n  when they follow you, you
      can grow your following much quicker. However, if you\n  have 5000 followers
      and follow 5000, you may not be seen as a guru.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use\n  lists.
      Lists allow you to categorize your Tweets for easier consumption. For instance,\n
      \ if user @Mule_kick writes about a topic of interest such as business models,
      create\n  a list called &quot;business models.&quot;</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Retweet.
      If you get an\n  interesting Tweet, simply re-Tweet it. In the Twitter world,
      more activity is generally\n  better.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>If you have a
      LinkedIn page</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Get\n  your profile gauge to 100%. You
      will see a completeness gauge showing how much of\n  your profile is complete.
      Keep going until you get 100%. It’s not that difficult.<br\n  /><!-- linkedin
      image --></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Join 5-10 groups. There are over 20,000\n  groups
      on LinkedIn. Find a few interesting ones and subscribe. You don’t need to\n
      \ participate in the discussion at first, but eventually jump into a conversation.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Link\n
      \ to your blog. If you have a blog, you can feed it to your LinkedIn page using
      Feedburner.\n  This will keep your page fresh and be almost no work.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use
      your personal\n  picture, not a logo. LinkedIn is about people connecting to
      people. It’s hard to\n  feel connected to a company if you are not Apple.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Don’t
      forget that\n  LinkedIn can be a great place to recruit employees. You have
      resumes right in front\n  of you. Search them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\tPick
      a connection strategy. There are\n  three basic connection strategies:\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Connect
      to everyone.\n  It is not recommended to connect with anyone and everyone. Sure,
      your connection\n  numbers will look great, but eventually someone will ask,
      &quot;Hey, I saw that\n  you know Mary Jones, can you introduce me.&quot; It
      may be quite embarrassing if\n  you don’t know who Mary Jones is.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Connect
      to only your most trusted\n  personal network. LinkedIn is great for leveraging
      the power of real-world networks.\n  However, this strategy may leave some benefits
      on the table. Instead, loosen up\n  the standard a bit and connect to people
      you have met but may not be lifelong friends.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Liberal\n
      \ connecting with actual connections. You should not connect with anyone you
      have\n  not met or spoken with. In fact, you probably should not connect with
      someone that\n  will not remember you or vica verse. However, if you can clear
      that bar, connect\n  away. The upside exceeds the downside.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>If\n
      \ you have a Facebook fan page</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Get more fans. Virality
      is over-rated\n  if you are not Lady Gaga. 99% of businesses have to WORK for
      likes. Remember the\n  old days trying to get customers to write testimonial
      letters. You had to scratch\n  and claw to get them. The same is true for Facebook
      likes. Many companies are offering\n  small bribes to get them. $5 off your
      next pizza if you like Bob’s Pizzeria. Ideally,\n  you should have 1000 or more
      fans.<br /><!-- facebook image --></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Feed\n  your blog into Facebook.
      Use Feedburner to automatically enter new blog posts on\n  your wall.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Make
      friends. Customers go to your Facebook page, then\n  they check out how many
      friends and likes you have. This is that &quot;social currency&quot;\n  you
      keep hearing about. Not enough friends or likes and something must be wrong.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Think\n
      \ of Facebook as free couponing. Kohl’s Department stores has over 1 million
      Facebook\n  friends. Why? Kohl’s sends special deals to its Facebook friends.
      Instead of printing\n  a coupon book, mailing it, and paying for postage, Kohl
      clicks a few buttons and\n  gets 1 million coupons distributed for free by Facebook.
      Not bad.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Best\n  Practices</h2>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Follow
      then get followed on Twitter. This is an\n  easy way to grow relevant colleagues.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blog.
      Yes, I know- you don’t\n  like to write. You don’t know what to say. Do it anyway.
      One post a month will do.\n  If you really hate to write, use Feedburner to
      pull good blogs into yours. For instance,\n  if you wanted to have all the posts
      for the Business Model Institute appear in your\n  blog automatically, use Feedburner
      feed <a href=\\\"http://feedburner.com/businessmodelinstitute\\\">http://feedburner.com/businessmodelinstitute</a>\n
      \ You can search feedburner.com for all the blogs available to feed.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>No\n
      \ one cares what you had for lunch. Please don’t Tweet just to Tweet.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Connect,\n
      \ not sell. Join the conversation as if you have nothing to sell. Be patient
      and the\n  sales will find you.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Answer questions on LinkedIn.
      The groups you\n  join will have questions. Create well-thought-out answers
      to an occasional question.\n  If your answer is selected &quot;best,&quot; this
      can create some nice social currency.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Virality\n  doesn’t just
      happen, you have to work it. Facebook games user bases grow 50% per\n  month...
      only once they have hit 100,000 users. They have to scrape, claw, borrow\n  and
      steal to get to 100,000 users.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use custom backgrounds. They
      are\n  cheap and free. Don’t be generic.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-18

      happen, you have to work it. Facebook games user bases grow 50% per\n  month...
      only once they have hit 100,000 users. They have to scrape, claw, borrow\n  and
      steal to get to 100,000 users.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use custom backgrounds. They
      are\n  cheap and free. Don’t be generic.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-18

      ! \"<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Because the main purpose and key to survival\n
      \ of any business is to generate cash, the ability for a business to generate
      cash\n  is usually the single largest value driver for a buyer. Although a buyer’s
      real\n  interest lies in the ability of a business to generate future cash flow,
      historical\n  numbers serve to validate, or invalidate, the various assumptions
      used in the prediction\n  of future cash generation.</p>\\r\\n<p>When a business
      changes hands, it will typically\n  continue along on its current trend line
      until such time that the buyer can influence\n  and improve the factors of sales
      volume, variable cost, and fixed cost. This fact\n  is relevant more so for
      financial buyers than for strategic buyers because financial\n  buyers have
      less ability to affect sales volume and costs in the short term, and\n  additional
      debt service could add to their costs.</p>\\r\\n<p>The slope created by\n  the
      combined historical and projected financial trend lines presents the buyer with\n
      \ a level of either greater or lesser financial risk. As they assess a possible
      acquisition\n  candidate, a buyer uses financial risk as one of their major
      criteria for determining\n  what they think the business is worth (the step
      of assigning value assumes the buyer\n  first concludes the business is an acceptable
      acquisition candidate). Remember they\n  only calculate value on 12 months trailing
      EBITDA, what the future holds is their\n  own assessment and they will not include
      any positive value, only any negative or\n  risk in future earnings.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based\n  on your score in this section,
      [Company Name] falls into the bottom third ranking\n  compared to where you
      should be in order to attract attention as a possible acquisition\n  candidate.
      [Company Name] lacks a sound financial track record and does not have\n  the
      basic business elements in place that are required in order to convince a buyer\n
      \ that the ability for the business to generate cash is just over the horizon.
      This\n  is especially true for a financial buyer because they lack the ability
      to absorb\n  poor financial performance or make quick improvements to turn the
      financial tide.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>In\n  order to be
      considered a possible acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must improve\n  the
      slope of financial risk. This is achieved by creating a minimum of a two-year\n
      \ history of improved cash generation based on specific improvements, such as
      new\n  or modified offerings and/or cost reductions, that can be demonstrated
      to have directly\n  contributed to acceptable and improving cash generation.
      These improvements, along\n  with any additional improvements that perhaps have
      not yet been demonstrated, will\n  then serve to project future cash generation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep
      in mind that any improvement\n  in general economic conditions as a contributing
      factor in your improved cash generation\n  will carry little weight in a buyer’s
      financial risk assessment for [Company Name].\n  We cannot stress enough that
      your improvements must come from positive changes that\n  you make to your business.
      These include who your customers are, what you offer\n  them, how effective
      you are at marketing and selling, the ability to extract higher\n  prices, and
      the costs of the materials and methods used to create your offering.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      you highly attractive\n  and allow you to realize a high multiple for your business.
      In other words, assuming\n  you do attract the attention of a buyer, your so-so
      ability to demonstrate historical\n  and future cash generation will definitely
      reduce the value that a buyer will assign.\n  In addition to price, it could
      also have a significant impact on other elements\n  of an offer such as the
      amount of cash paid at closing.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ order to be considered a top-tier acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must
      improve\n  the slope of its financial performance by creating a significant
      upward improvement\n  over a 12-month period. Upward trending financials must
      be based on specific changes\n  made to the business such as new or modified
      offerings, price improvements, cost\n  reductions, enhanced marketing and selling,
      a more loyal and informed customer base,\n  improved competitive advantage,

      &mdash; before, during, and after the\n  transaction. No business is exempt
      from this rule.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since the past successes\n  of a company’s offerings
      have no bearing on the ability to generate future sales,\n  buyers are only
      interested in the value the market is going to place on a company’s\n  offerings
      going forward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Buyers look for products to have some runway\n  ahead
      of them in the product life cycle and not be rendered obsolete in the foreseeable\n
      \ future.  Ideal products are distinctively different from their competitors,
      and\n  have real sustainable competitive advantage, Knowing the value customers
      place on\n  a company’s offerings is a key driver in that company’s ability
      to sell and generate\n  cash. They understand that high value added products
      attract and retain more customers,\n  and in many cases, high value allows for
      higher prices and stronger margins &mdash;\n  while low value has the opposite
      effect.</p>\\r\\n<p>The degree to which offerings\n  are differentiated, sustainable
      and competitive correlates directly with the degree\n  of risk for the buyer,
      and risk correlates to their interest in the company and\n  the price they are
      willing to pay.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based\n
      \ on your score in this section, [Company Name] is in top third ranking. Your
      position\n  in the top third will help you attract the attention of buyers because
      strong offerings\n  provide the buyer with greater confidence when projecting
      sales, margins, and their\n  resulting cash flow. As mentioned earlier, greater
      confidence equals reduced risk\n  for the buyer, allowing them to present a
      more substantial offer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Although\n
      \ you enjoy strong offerings, it would be wise for you to put effort into further\n
      \ strengthening your offerings until you are ready to sell. While this should
      not\n  be a priority, remember that buyers place significant importance on a
      company’s\n  offerings; therefore, any effort and cost put into this area will
      be returned several\n  times over as the enhanced value of your offerings are
      magnified by a higher sales\n  multiple.  Be certain you understand and can
      clearly articulate your distinct product\n  differentiation and sustainable
      competitive advantages.  If you can further strengthen\n  them you will find
      even greater value in your business.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 21:49:23.743199000Z\nupdated_at:

      but not least, buyers\n  tend to show little interest in companies when sales

      is sold, even if the owner agrees to\n  stay on in a sales role or through a
      transition period (which typically do not work\n  out well), there is too much
      risk associated with a sales process based exclusively\n  on owner/customer
      relationships and they will discount for this as lower revenue.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n
      \ Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based on your scoring in this section,
      [Company\n  Name] is placed in the lower third ranking. Your weak marketing
      and sales process\n  not only makes [Company Name] a less attractive acquisition
      candidate, it makes\n  you vulnerable to the reality of not generating enough
      sales to sustain your business\n  should one or two unexpected internal or external
      events occur.</p>\\r\\n<p>Being\n  in the lower third means any buyer attention
      would come from a smaller pool. Interested\n  buyers would most likely be strategic
      buyers such as local competitors trying to\n  reduce their competition, or buyers
      located elsewhere with synergistic offerings\n  who would like to expand their
      capabilities or move into your market location. Nevertheless,\n  any offer coming
      your way could be moderately to heavily discounted. It should be\n  expected
      that an offer from a financial buyer would be far more discounted than\n  an
      offer from a strategic buyer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Unless
      you\n  are aware of a strategic buyer who has expressed a serious interest in
      [Company\n  Name] and/or you have a highly unique offering that has enough value
      to offset your\n  weak marketing and sales process, you face a serious issue
      that requires immediate\n  attention. We suggest that you first prioritize your
      deficiencies. Then make improvements\n  on a prioritized basis. Keep in mind
      that process changes like these require both\n  determination and time to accomplish
      but fortunately, they do not necessarily require\n  capital investment.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      generate sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although\n  a weak marketing and sales process can
      be somewhat less important to a strategic\n  buyer because they often have the
      ability to more quickly shore-up deficiencies\n  in the process, they will still
      lower the value because they have to invest in it\n  and know others will discount
      as well. Remember, the pool of strategic buyers is\n  generally smaller than
      the financial buyer pool.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Because\n
      \ [Company Name] already has some of the essential elements of an acceptable
      marketing\n  and sales process, you would not be required to start over or make
      large structural\n  changes to the process. However, we suggest that you make
      a concerted effort to\n  improve the process. You will likely need a segmentation
      analysis and an objective\n  look at your sales process. Although you may have
      some sales talent, this ranking\n  indicates you may not have a robust process.

      ! \"<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Business valuation for [Company Name] is directly\n
      \ related to the ability of the business to run without the owner. This does
      not mean\n  for a day or a week but forever after the owner is gone. As the
      owner, if you leave\n  the company for three months and it can continue to perform
      just as well without\n  your involvement in that three-month period as it would
      have if you were involved,\n  you can achieve reasonable value.</p>\\r\\n<p>Unfortunately,
      other factors relating\n  to the abilities and capabilities of your management
      team and key employees can\n  potentially be significant value detractors from
      [Company Name]. Key among them\n  is the longevity and runway ahead of your
      management team. Clearly, buying a business\n  with experienced management that
      are all planning to retire in the next few years\n  is just as risky as an inexperienced
      team. Business value comes from that perfect\n  balance of age, experience and
      ability.</p>\\r\\n<p>Management must also be committed\n  to [Company Name];
      otherwise the situation is considered dangerous and risky. A\n  buyer will want
      them committed to contracts that include non-competes and limit\n  the risk
      of trade secrets being exposed, competitors hiring your people, or key\n  employees
      who become competitors themselves. In some severe situations where it\n  is
      likely management will leave and become competitors after an ownership change,\n
      \ the business value will be zero. The risk will be judged too high.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another\n
      \ key value factor for [Company Name] is the level of tribal knowledge. Although
      we\n  all value employees who know what they are doing, we do not want to have
      to depend\n  on them as the only ones who know how to do things. Documented
      process for doing\n  things in the business is another major value driver. In
      this way there is little\n  risk should you lose a key employee. Buyers focus
      heavily on this documentation\n  and consider a business reliant on key people
      and lacking documentation of key processes\n  as very risky. They will make
      a big discount of value for these factors. It does\n  not matter if it is a
      strategic or financial buyer; both will need the same confidence\n  in management,
      people and commitment. The only difference is the length of time\n  they need
      them.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Like many\n
      \ privately held businesses [Company Name] has a level of owner involvement
      and dependence\n  that is very high placing them in the lower third on the index.
      Although it may\n  feel like the company has a good team and has delegated tasks
      to them, the owner\n  is still very involved in daily activities and the business
      cannot stand on its\n  own without them and without some key employees. The
      processes of [Company Name]\n  are not well enough documented to ensure the
      business can continue to run well.\n  This limits value in that a new owner
      may not be able to step in and be successful\n  right away. A potential buyer
      will need significant time and money to replace what\n  the owner knows. Further,
      this reflects badly on the [Company Name] management team\n  indicating they
      are not the reliable team to carry the business forward, which translates\n
      \ to even more risk for the buyer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>An
      objective,\n  critical evaluation of the [Company Name] management team, internal
      processes and\n  documentation is necessary to move forward. A full review considering
      longevity,\n  runway for the team, the level of process documentation and your
      employment contracts\n  and agreements is necessary. This review may take as
      much as two to three years\n  to maximize the value of the management team.
      Keep in mind, the balance of longevity\n  and runway are both important so presenting
      a business with a young management team\n  and six months experience may reduce
      value as much or even more than a team with\n  little runway.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      and when [Company Name] goes on the market, the business\n  and management team
      will face a completely new set of issues. Both the business\n  and management
      will be spotlighted and intensely evaluated. Care should be taken\n  to secure
      the management team with stay packages through the sale process as well\n  as
      good coaching provided by experienced people so they can hold up well and properly\n
      \ show their capabilities and abilities to a buyer.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19

      reduction. With only some processes\n  documented, [Company Name] needs to document
      more in order to insure it is not too\n  dependent on key employees and can
      still serve all customers well without them.\n  Just the same, a new owner will
      still view the purchase of [Company Name] as risky\n  due to this dependence

      competitors\n  to a new owner and perhaps have good reasons to stay with them.
      Money spent to insure\n  your management team is tied up should also include

      ! \"<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Business owners must understand that to a buyer,\n
      \ assets only have value to the extent that they are capable of generating cash;
      therefore,\n  the value of an asset is tied directly to its sales opportunity
      &mdash; or the lack\n  thereof. As an example, a new piece of machinery sitting
      idle without a customer\n  is only worth its fair market value as used equipment,
      not what the owner paid for\n  it or the value sitting on the owner’s books.
      This rule holds true for any asset\n  category such as plant equipment, inventory,
      patents, and so on (with the exception\n  of cash and cash equivalents), And
      keep in mind that receivables are only as good\n  as their ability to be collected.
      A good rule to remember is that assets, regardless\n  of their initial cost,
      are only worth their liquidation value unless they are capable\n  of generating
      future cash flow &mdash; so in order to increase the value of assets,\n  sales
      volume for those assets must increase. Try as they may, sellers cannot escape\n
      \ this rule.</p>\\r\\n<p>In an asset sale, the buyer is interested almost exclusively\n
      \ in the value of the company’s assets and the ability to restate them at a
      higher\n  value and begin to depreciate them post purchase, (minus cash and
      cash equivalents)\n  and pays little attention to liabilities because liabilities
      remain with the seller.\n  In some cases, if certain liabilities transfer to
      the buyer, those liabilities will\n  be factored directly into a discounted
      price. The strength of a company’s assets\n  will have more bearing in price
      than salability.</p>\\r\\n<p>In a stock sale, a buyer\n  purchases both the
      assets and the liabilities; therefore, the buyer will have a\n  keen interest
      in both and they will make sure they understand the value of both.\n  These
      include contingent liabilities not on the balance sheet that could have a\n
      \ future impact in the business such as possible litigation, a union threat,
      etc.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n  Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based on your
      scoring in this section, [Company\n  Name] is placed in the lower third ranking.
      While sections such as products and\n  services, customers, and competitors
      are inherently more important to a buyer (because\n  those sections are beyond

      items that\n  make up your liabilities, prioritize them according to their impact
      on the wellbeing\n  of your business, and put forth an effort to diminish them.

      could simply put you out of business or certainly\n  cause severe damage to

      age,\n  reasonable experience and tenure as well as good human resource management.
      This\n  means a proven and repeatable hiring process, a successful safety program
      and safety\n  record, an employee handbook with good discipline procedures that
      are adhered to,\n  little or no history of or risk of employee related claims
      against the company.\n  The presence of, or the risk of, a union is an obvious
      value detractor but depending\n  upon the region of the country and nature of
      the union, it could have a varying\n  valuation impact.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>The [Company\n  Name] human resource situation
      is in the lower third. It will be perceived as risky\n  and reduces its value.
      Your employee turnover, age factors and overall people situation\n  is in need
      of repair. The score and data indicate that you will be perceived to\n  have
      fairly poor morale and people problems. It is likely that meaningful performance\n
      \ management is absent, policies and procedures are not being followed and the
      handbook\n  is not up to date or evenly applied.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Since\n
      \ the sources of employee problems are usually not found in only one area, an
      objective\n  and complete review of the people situation is the best solution.
      To improve the\n  situation, policies and procedures need to be fully reviewed
      by an objective outsider.\n  .The review should include employee manuals, hiring
      policies, work rules, employee\n  goals and objectives and any measurements
      used in the company. This should be augmented\n  by employee interviews and
      possibly surveys. As a result of this process, [Company\n  Name] will need to

      your human resource\n  issues are not a major value deduction. A big risk is

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored below average on this aspect.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Because\n
      \ the main purpose and key to survival of any business is to generate cash,
      the ability\n  for a business to generate cash is usually the single largest
      value driver for a\n  buyer. Although a buyer’s real interest lies in the ability
      of a business to generate\n  future cash flow, historical numbers serve to validate,
      or invalidate, the various\n  assumptions used in the prediction of future cash
      generation.</p>\\r\\n<p>When a business\n  changes hands, it will typically
      continue along on its current trend line until\n  such time that the buyer can
      influence and improve the factors of sales volume,\n  variable cost, and fixed
      cost. This fact is relevant more so for financial buyers\n  than for strategic
      buyers because financial buyers have less ability to affect sales\n  volume
      and costs in the short term, and additional debt service could add to their\n
      \ costs.</p>\\r\\n<p>The slope created by the combined historical and projected
      financial\n  trend lines presents the buyer with a level of either greater or
      lesser financial\n  risk. As they assess a possible acquisition candidate, a
      buyer uses financial risk\n  as one of their major criteria for determining
      what they think the business is worth\n  (the step of assigning value assumes
      the buyer first concludes the business is an\n  acceptable acquisition candidate).
      Remember they only calculate value on 12 months\n  trailing EBITDA, what the
      future holds is their own assessment and they will not\n  include any positive
      value, only any negative or risk in future earnings.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n
      \ Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based on your score in this section, [Company\n
      \ Name] falls into the bottom third ranking compared to where you should be
      in order\n  to attract attention as a possible acquisition candidate. [Company
      Name] lacks a\n  sound financial track record and does not have the basic business
      elements in place\n  that are required in order to convince a buyer that the
      ability for the business\n  to generate cash is just over the horizon. This
      is especially true for a financial\n  buyer because they lack the ability to
      absorb poor financial performance or make\n  quick improvements to turn the
      financial tide.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>In\n  order to be
      considered a possible acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must improve\n  the
      slope of financial risk. This is achieved by creating a minimum of a two-year\n
      \ history of improved cash generation based on specific improvements, such as
      new\n  or modified offerings and/or cost reductions, that can be demonstrated
      to have directly\n  contributed to acceptable and improving cash generation.
      These improvements, along\n  with any additional improvements that perhaps have
      not yet been demonstrated, will\n  then serve to project future cash generation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep
      in mind that any improvement\n  in general economic conditions as a contributing
      factor in your improved cash generation\n  will carry little weight in a buyer’s
      financial risk assessment for [Company Name].\n  We cannot stress enough that
      your improvements must come from positive changes that\n  you make to your business.
      These include who your customers are, what you offer\n  them, how effective
      you are at marketing and selling, the ability to extract higher\n  prices, and
      the costs of the materials and methods used to create your offering.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      financial\n  attributes that would make you highly attractive and allow you
      to realize a high\n  multiple for your business. In other words, assuming you
      do attract the attention\n  of a buyer, your so-so ability to demonstrate historical
      and future cash generation\n  will definitely reduce the value that a buyer
      will assign. In addition to price,\n  it could also have a significant impact
      on other elements of an offer such as the\n  amount of cash paid at closing.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>In
      order to\n  be considered a top-tier acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must
      improve the\n  slope of its financial performance by creating a significant
      upward improvement\n  over a 12-month period. Upward trending financials must
      be based on specific changes\n  made to the business such as new or modified
      offerings, price improvements, cost\n  reductions, enhanced marketing and selling,
      a more loyal and informed customer base,\n  improved competitive advantage,
      etc.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep in mind that improved general\n  economic conditions will
      carry little weight in a buyer’s financial risk assessment\n  for [Company Name].
      Improved financial performance must come from changes that you\n  make to your
      business &mdash; not from outside economic factors.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-18

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored above average on this aspect.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>When\n
      \ a business changes hands, it will typically continue along on its current
      trend\n  line until such time that the buyer can influence and improve the factors
      of sales\n  volume, variable cost, and fixed cost. This fact is relevant more
      so for financial\n  buyers than for strategic buyers because financial buyers
      have less ability to affect\n  sales volume and costs in the short term, and
      additional debt service could add\n  to their costs.</p>\\r\\n<p>The slope created
      by the combined historical and projected\n  financial trend lines presents the
      buyer with a level of either greater or lesser\n  financial risk. As they assess
      a possible acquisition candidate, a buyer uses financial\n  risk as one of their
      major criteria for assigning a value to what they think the\n  business is worth
      (the step of assigning value assumes the buyer first concludes\n  the business
      is an acceptable acquisition candidate). Remember they only calculate\n  value
      on 12-months trailing EBITDA; what the future holds is their own assessment\n
      \ and they will not include any positive value, only any negative or risk in
      future\n  earnings.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based
      on your score\n  in this section, [Company Name] is in the top third ranking.
      Placement in the top\n  third will definitely help you attract the attention
      of buyers. Your ability to\n  maintain sales and control costs, as indicated
      by strong cash flow throughout the\n  economic downturn, speaks well for the
      overall strength of your business. To a buyer\n  looking at your business, this
      strength allows them to confidently project future\n  cash generation, which
      minimizes their risk and allows them to strengthen any offer\n  they tender.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>While
      your placement in the top\n  third is a clear advantage for you, you would be
      wise to consider ways to further\n  improve EBITDA and strengthen your market
      position. Doing so will improve your chances\n  of receiving an optimized price
      when the time comes for you to sell. Efforts should\n  be focused on further
      increasing customer value, maintaining or even improving your\n  pricing strategies,
      further defining and refining all internal processes including\n  the marketing
      and selling process, and finding additional methods to control and\n  reduce
      your costs. Remember, increased EBITDA will be multiplied into the price\n  offered
      and improved market position will enhance the multiplier</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      Buyers\n  will make this a key area of critical review. Buyers are looking for
      the impact\n  of economic cycles, the risk to the business of losing customers
      or being overly\n  dependent upon risky customers, markets, and sectors. For
      instance, a business highly\n  dependent upon automotive customers who are impacted

      in a stable, low variation industry\n  such as a public utility or pharmaceuticals.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      big factor for any\n  company is being dependent upon a small number of customers
      that make up a large\n  percentage of your business. It is very risky and if
      a large customer is lost it\n  can have a catastrophic impact on the company.
      The risk of losing a significant\n  customer when transitioning ownership of
      a business is always very high. Many buyers\n  hold the previous owner responsible
      and use earn outs or incentive programs to the\n  seller based upon their commitment
      and ability to keep a customer after a sale.</p>\\r\\n<p>Major\n  consideration
      is also given to diversity of the customer base. A multi-market customer\n  base
      that is financially healthy is less risky than a single vertical market. Value\n
      \ and buyers look for a customer base that allows them to have consistent revenue\n
      \ and sales all year and from year to year. Without this balance, significant
      value\n  is lost.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company
      Name] has\n  a poor customer situation ranking in the lower third of the index.
      The business\n  is very dependent upon customers and markets that put the revenue
      stream at risk.\n  This high-risk customer base will encourage a lower valuation.
      A typical buyer will\n  assume losing business soon after buying the business].
      It will make the valuation\n  lower and even if earn outs and post transaction
      incentives are included in the\n  valuation, they are rarely fully earned by
      a seller. This risk factor is very significant\n  and, as noted, a dramatic
      deduction against EBITDA will be made. The customer situation\n  could simply
      be a deal killer and make the company virtually unsellable.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company\n
      \ Name] should make some customer base changes in order to build value and make
      the\n  company more appealing in the marketplace and to potential buyers. Starting
      with\n  a customer base evaluation, [Company Name] needs to rethink and overhaul
      its business\n  mode, and market strategy. Emphasis should be given to customer
      diversity, market\n  and customer financial health and its sales processes to
      reshape the customer base.\n  This is a long-term issue and may require several
      years to correct in order to lower\n  the risk factor. Sometimes companies tend
      to have an emotional attachment to customers\n  and business models that others
      would quickly change. Be sure to take an objective\n  look at the situation
      (like the buyer will) to get an unemotional view.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19

      customer after a sale.</p>\\r\\n<p>Major\n  consideration is also given to diversity
      of the customer base. A multi-market customer\n  base that is financially healthy
      is less risky than a single vertical market. Value\n  and buyers look for a
      customer base that allows them to have consistent revenue\n  and sales all year
      and from year to year. Without this balance, significant value\n  is lost.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company Name] has\n  a middle third ranking
      in its level of risk in its customer base. Although you may\n  consider this
      similar to most companies, in reality there is still risk of losing\n  some
      customers due to the company’s dependence on a higher risk customer situation\n
      \ and markets. The customer base lacks sufficient diversity to value it as a
      solid\n  on-going revenue stream. A buyer will discount revenue and EBITDA for
      some factor\n  of lost sales. As you will recall, this has a significant impact
      on EBITDA and the\n  multiplier. A buyer will assume [Company Name] has an unstable
      revenue trend.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Obviously\n  [Company
      Name] needs to address their revenue risk issues. The business needs to\n  make
      some customer base changes in order to reduce dependence on risky customers,\n
      \ build value and make the company more appealing in the marketplace and to
      potential\n  buyers. You should start with an objective a customer base evaluation.
      [Company\n  Name] needs to rethink its current market strategy and consider
      expanding or diversifying\n  its markets. Emphasis should be given to customer
      diversity, market and customer\n  financial health and its sales processes to
      reshape the customer base. This is a\n  long-term issue and may require several
      years to correct and lower the risk factor.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 21:49:23.783154000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored above average on this section.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Recurring\n
      \ and consistent revenue is extremely important... The level of risk in the
      customer\n  base and the revenue stream can seriously detract from business
      valuation. Buyers\n  will make this a key area of critical review. Buyers are
      looking for the impact\n  of economic cycles, the risk to the business of losing
      customers or being overly\n  dependent upon risky customers, markets, and sectors.
      For instance, a business highly\n  dependent upon automotive customers who are
      impacted by widely swinging automotive\n  business cycles has a lower value
      than customers in a stable, low variation industry\n  such as a public utility
      or pharmaceuticals.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another big factor for any\n  company is being
      dependent upon a small number of customers that make up a large\n  percentage
      of your business. It is very risky and if a large customer is lost it\n  can
      have a catastrophic impact on the company. The risk of losing a significant\n
      \ customer when transitioning ownership of a business is always very high. Many
      buyers\n  hold the previous owner responsible and use earn outs or incentive
      programs to the\n  seller based upon their commitment and ability to keep a
      customer after a sale.</p>\\r\\n<p>Major\n  consideration is also given to diversity
      of the customer base. A multi-market customer\n  base that is financially healthy
      is less risky than a single vertical market. Value\n  and buyers look for a
      customer base that allows them to have consistent revenue\n  and sales all year
      and from year to year. Without this balance, significant value\n  is lost.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>The [Company Name]\n  customer base is solid.
      Although a willing buyer will see some risk in the revenue\n  stream, it still
      represents a reliable revenue stream going forward. The customer\n  base shows
      the elements of diversity, stability and has limited dependence on risky\n  customers
      or markets. Moreover, history appears to indicate that lost customer revenue\n
      \ is easily recovered with new business. Although [Company Name] could view
      this situation\n  as an opportunity to take a little more risk and grab some
      business opportunistically\n  for short-term gains, doing so will introduce
      a great deal of instability in the\n  business and then detract from value.
      Care should be taken to not take on more risk\n  and destroy value.</p>\\r\\n<p>Going
      forward [Company Name] needs to continually review\n  its customer base to insure
      it maintains diversity and does not become dependent\n  on risky customers.
      A normal product and business life cycle will cause [Company\n  Name] to naturally
      move to a higher risk customer base. Objective and careful monitoring\n  and
      control is needed to insure this good situation and company value is maintained.\n
      \ An objective, semi-annual or annual customer review with an eye to market
      trends\n  and the health and future of that market is important. Be prepared
      to revise your\n  business model and go to market strategies to stay ahead of
      the natural life-cycle\n  curves.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 21:49:23.788963000Z\nupdated_at:

      Although\n  your relative size and the growth trends of the markets in which
      you participate\n  is a key factor, so are market share and the competitive
      environment. Having several\n  competitors and no single dominant competitor
      is indicative of growth opportunity.\n  However, if the market is dominated
      by one competitor, the growth potential and\n  value are severely limited.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although
      at times it seems counter-intuitive,\n  a market share so small that the company
      lacks critical mass to move forward and\n  grow is a significant problem. It
      is as bad as when one single competitor controls\n  the marketplace. A 15% share
      of served market is an indicator of critical mass in\n  order to grow the business
      while a 65% market share is an indicator the company\n  has limited growth potential
      in the same way a 65% single competitor market share\n  limits the growth opportunity.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      key to market share and growth potential\n  is having a sustainable competitive
      advantage. Buyers will look for this in assessing\n  value. Advantages over
      the competition, which competitors cannot easily duplicate,\n  will be a big
      value driver. When your product or service has no significant advantage\n  your
      revenue is again at risk and your growth potential is more limited. Although\n
      \ past performance is usually a great indicator of value and future value, without\n
      \ clear growth opportunity [Company Name] value will be significantly less than
      past\n  performance would otherwise indicate.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current
      Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>The\n  competitive situation for [Company Name] indicates
      your growth opportunity and current\n  revenue stream are at risk. Your competitive
      index in the lower third indicates\n  that you cannot easily grow or expand
      without significant resources being spent\n  to change or make a market shift
      and assure revenue growth. [Company Name] does\n  not have a clear sustainable
      competitive advantage and is in an environment where\n  the competitors have
      the upper hand. The competitive dynamic must change in order\n  to build business
      value.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>To change the dynamic,\n  [Company
      Name] should start by completing an objective competitive analysis and\n  review
      to identify an alternative competitive approach and possibly your business\n
      \ model. Most companies are functionally in a confrontational competitive situation\n
      \ where there is no real advantage and from time to time each is merely able
      to get\n  an upper hand and sustain it for relatively short periods. The solution
      that delivers\n  value is to identify and pursue a true sustainable competitive
      advantage. Doing\n  so will require a review of the customers and their use
      of the company’s product\n  or service and all the major elements of the company
      to identify where and how to\n  build a competitive advantage.</p>\\r\\n<p>It
      would be worthwhile for [Company Name]\n  to review the five or six primary
      competitive strategies that can be pursued. This\n  will help move the company
      away from the current confrontational strategy and to\n  pursue a gorilla, niching
      or other more effective strategy. In addition some combination\n  of a change
      in your business model, market served or product offering might be necessary\n
      \ to improve your competitive situation.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 21:49:23.825824000Z\nupdated_at:

      to grow the business while a 65% market share is an indicator the\n  company
      has limited growth potential in the same way a 65% single competitor market\n

      which competitors\n  cannot easily duplicate, will be a big value driver. When
      your product or service\n  has no significant advantage your revenue is again
      at risk and your growth potential\n  is more limited. Although past performance
      is usually a great indicator of value\n  and future value, without clear growth

      otherwise indicate.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current\n  Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>The
      index scored [Company Name] in the middle third for competitive\n  situation.
      This indicates the company will be challenged to grow and gain on the\n  competition.
      What competitive advantage that may exist does not appear to be compelling\n
      \ or sustainable for a long period of time, even if it is working reasonably
      well\n  for the moment. Although [Company Name] has some growth opportunity
      it is limited\n  and this hurts your valuation. A buyer will view your competitive
      situation as needing\n  significant investment to make the business grow going
      forward and to change the\n  competitive dynamic.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>A
      sustainable competitive\n  advantage will add real value to [Company Name].
      The solution should begin with\n  re-examination of its product offering, customers
      and markets served, value chain\n  and an objective competitive analysis. This
      may take outside help, some additional\n  resources and time, but these are
      the same resources a buyer would spend and then\n  discount against value in
      order to invest on their own. Most companies are functionally\n  in a confrontational
      competitive situation where there is no real advantage and\n  from time to time
      each is able to get an upper hand and only sustain it for short\n  periods of
      time. To break out of this form of competition, [Company Name] needs\n  to review
      the five or six primary competitive strategies that can be pursued and\n  consider
      a change to a more targeted strategy like niching or gorilla approaches.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      environment. Having several\n  competitors with no single dominant competitor
      is indicative of growth opportunity.\n  However, if the market is dominated
      by one competitor the growth potential and value\n  are severely limited.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although
      at times it seems counterintuitive, a market\n  share so small that the company
      lacks critical mass to move forward and grow is\n  a significant problem. It

      indicators of growth opportunity. The value is created when sales growth occurs.\n
      \ It is critical that [Company Name] generate double-digit revenue growth for

      needs to complete objective semi-annual market and competitive reviews\n  to
      consider all the dynamics at play and be prepared to do what it takes to keep\n

      on your scoring in this section, [Company\n  Name] is placed in the lower third

      a less attractive acquisition candidate, it makes\n  you vulnerable to the reality
      of not generating enough sales to sustain your business\n  should one or two
      unexpected internal or external events occur.</p>\\r\\n<p>Being\n  in the lower
      third means any buyer attention would come from a smaller pool. Interested\n
      \ buyers would most likely be strategic buyers such as local competitors trying

      offerings\n  who would like to expand their capabilities or move into your market
      location. Nevertheless,\n  any offer coming your way could be moderately to

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored high on this section.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>The\n
      \ best way to improve the bottom line is to improve the top line. Since sales
      is the\n  single most important indicator of success, buyers look for companies
      with a robust\n  process to uncover sales leads and convert those leads into
      customers. Buyers like\n  to see a sales process that has been proven effective
      through measured inputs and\n  outputs, and one that is repeatedly followed.
      They also look for processes that\n  are disciplined in maintaining contact
      with current and even past customers in order\n  to secure repeat business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Buyers
      place significant importance on seeing\n  sales spread across many customers
      rather than just a few, and they prefer to see\n  customers from a mixture of
      market sectors rather than a concentration in one or\n  two sectors. The reasons
      for these preferences are obvious &mdash; relying on a\n  few large customers,
      or having all customers grouped in one or two market sectors\n  is like having
      all your eggs in one basket. It presents great risk if a customer\n  or a sector
      goes away.</p>\\r\\n<p>Last but not least, buyers tend to show little\n  interest
      in companies when sales rest on the shoulders of the owner. Buyers understand\n
      \ that once a company is sold, even if the owner agrees to stay on in a sales
      role\n  or through a transition period (which typically do not work out well),
      there is\n  too much risk associated with a sales process based exclusively
      on owner/customer\n  relationships and they will discount for this as lower
      revenue.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n  Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based
      on your score in this section, [Company\n  Name] is in the top third ranking,
      making you attractive to a larger pool of buyers.\n  In particular, it opens
      up a greater number of financial buyers who rely on an inherently\n  strong
      marketing and sales process on the day they take over the business. You should\n
      \ not see a significant value reduction for sales and marketing.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Because\n
      \ the marketing and sales process is quite important to buyers, we recommend
      you continue\n  to fine-tune your process. Work on measuring the effectiveness
      of [Company Name]\n  to uncover leads and effectively convert them to active
      customers. Make adjustments\n  where opportunities exist. Remember that your
      sales price is some multiple of the\n  cash you are generating, and nothing
      generates cash faster that improving sales.\n  Therefore, your efforts to improve
      this process should pay you back multiple times.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored low on this section.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Business\n
      \ valuation for [Company Name] is directly related to the ability of the business\n
      \ to run without the owner. This does not mean for a day or a week but forever
      after\n  the owner is gone. As the owner, if you leave the company for three
      months and it\n  can continue to perform just as well without your involvement
      in that three-month\n  period as it would have if you were involved, you can
      achieve reasonable value.</p>\\r\\n<p>Unfortunately,\n  other factors relating
      to the abilities and capabilities of your management team\n  and key employees
      can potentially be significant value detractors from [Company\n  Name]. Key
      among them is the longevity and runway ahead of your management team.\n  Clearly,
      buying a business with experienced management that are all planning to\n  retire
      in the next few years is just as risky as an inexperienced team. Business\n
      \ value comes from that perfect balance of age, experience and ability.</p>\\r\\n<p>Management\n
      \ must also be committed to [Company Name]; otherwise the situation is considered\n
      \ dangerous and risky. A buyer will want them committed to contracts that include\n
      \ non-competes and limit the risk of trade secrets being exposed, competitors
      hiring\n  your people, or key employees who become competitors themselves. In
      some severe\n  situations where it is likely management will leave and become
      competitors after\n  an ownership change, the business value will be zero. The
      risk will be judged too\n  high.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another key value factor for [Company
      Name] is the level of tribal\n  knowledge. Although we all value employees who
      know what they are doing, we do not\n  want to have to depend on them as the
      only ones who know how to do things. Documented\n  process for doing things
      in the business is another major value driver. In this\n  way there is little
      risk should you lose a key employee. Buyers focus heavily on\n  this documentation
      and consider a business reliant on key people and lacking documentation\n  of
      key processes as very risky. They will make a big discount of value for these\n
      \ factors. It does not matter if it is a strategic or financial buyer; both
      will need\n  the same confidence in management, people and commitment. The only
      difference is\n  the length of time they need them.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name]
      Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Like\n  many privately held businesses [Company
      Name] has a level of owner involvement and\n  dependence that is very high placing
      them in the lower third on the index. Although\n  it may feel like the company
      has a good team and has delegated tasks to them, the\n  owner is still very
      involved in daily activities and the business cannot stand on\n  its own without
      them and without some key employees. The processes of [Company Name]\n  are
      not well enough documented to ensure the business can continue to run well.\n
      \ This limits value in that a new owner may not be able to step in and be successful\n
      \ right away. A potential buyer will need significant time and money to replace
      what\n  the owner knows. Further, this reflects badly on the [Company Name]
      management team\n  indicating they are not the reliable team to carry the business
      forward, which translates\n  to even more risk for the buyer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>An
      objective,\n  critical evaluation of the [Company Name] management team, internal
      processes and\n  documentation is necessary to move forward. A full review considering
      longevity,\n  runway for the team, the level of process documentation and your
      employment contracts\n  and agreements is necessary. This review may take as
      much as two to three years\n  to maximize the value of the management team.
      Keep in mind, the balance of longevity\n  and runway are both important so presenting
      a business with a young management team\n  and six months experience may reduce
      value as much or even more than a team with\n  little runway.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      and when [Company Name] goes on the market, the business\n  and management team
      will face a completely new set of issues. Both the business\n  and management
      will be spotlighted and intensely evaluated. Care should be taken\n  to secure
      the management team with stay packages through the sale process as well\n  as
      good coaching provided by experienced people so they can hold up well and properly\n
      \ show their capabilities and abilities to a buyer.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19

      Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Although\n  the [Company Name] can run without the owner
      for periods of time, it is still very\n  dependent upon a one or two people
      for success. While this level of owner involvement\n  is common for owner-led
      businesses, it is still a value reduction. With only some\n  processes documented,
      [Company Name] needs to document more in order to insure it\n  is not too dependent
      on key employees and can still serve all customers well without\n  them. Just
      the same, a new owner will still view the purchase of [Company Name]\n  as risky
      due to this dependence on the owner and key people and will discount significantly\n
      \ for all the cost of building documentation and risk associated with not having
      it.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company\n  Name] needs to review
      and consider improvement in the management team. There are\n  issues relating
      to their capability, commitment and runway. The company needs to\n  insure they
      have tight employment agreements keeping them from becoming competitors\n  to
      a new owner and perhaps have good reasons to stay with them. Money spent to
      insure\n  your management team is tied up should also include stay packages
      for transition.\n  Once you document your processes and reduce dependence upon
      the owner, what you\n  spend will be returned to you in a much higher business
      valuation. If and when [Company\n  Name] goes on the market, the business and
      management team will face a completely\n  new set of issues. Both will be spotlighted
      and intensely evaluated. Care should\n  be taken to prepare the management team
      for the sale process as well as good coaching\n  provided by experienced people
      so they can hold up well and properly show their\n  capabilities and abilities
      to a buyer.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 22:16:34.342828000Z\nupdated_at: 2012-01-23

      too costly\n  to terminate should a buyer wish to get out of an agreement at
      a reasonable cost\n  in the future. It would be normal for a buyer to discount
      the cost of terminating\n  an employment agreement from EBITDA and lower the
      purchase price significantly.\n  If and when [Company Name] goes on the market
      and is put up for sale, the business\n  and management team will face a completely
      new set of issues. Both the business\n  and management will be spotlighted and
      intensely evaluated. Care should be taken\n  to secure the management team through
      the sale process with stay packages, training\n  and good coaching provided
      by experienced people so they can hold up well and properly\n  show their capabilities
      and abilities to a buyer.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 22:16:34.349010000Z\nupdated_at:

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored low on this section.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Business\n
      \ owners must understand that to a buyer, assets only have value to the extent
      that\n  they are capable of generating cash; therefore, the value of an asset
      is tied directly\n  to its sales opportunity &mdash; or the lack thereof. As
      an example, a new piece\n  of machinery sitting idle without a customer is only
      worth its fair market value\n  as used equipment, not what the owner paid for
      it or the value sitting on the owner’s\n  books. This rule holds true for any
      asset category such as plant equipment, inventory,\n  patents, and so on (with
      the exception of cash and cash equivalents), And keep in\n  mind that receivables
      are only as good as their ability to be collected. A good\n  rule to remember
      is that assets, regardless of their initial cost, are only worth\n  their liquidation
      value unless they are capable of generating future cash flow &mdash;\n  so in
      order to increase the value of assets, sales volume for those assets must\n
      \ increase. Try as they may, sellers cannot escape this rule.</p>\\r\\n<p>In
      an asset\n  sale, the buyer is interested almost exclusively in the value of
      the company’s assets\n  and the ability to restate them at a higher value and
      begin to depreciate them post\n  purchase, (minus cash and cash equivalents)
      and pays little attention to liabilities\n  because liabilities remain with
      the seller. In some cases, if certain liabilities\n  transfer to the buyer,
      those liabilities will be factored directly into a discounted\n  price. The
      strength of a company’s assets will have more bearing in price than salability.</p>\\r\\n<p>In\n
      \ a stock sale, a buyer purchases both the assets and the liabilities; therefore,\n
      \ the buyer will have a keen interest in both and they will make sure they understand\n
      \ the value of both. These include contingent liabilities not on the balance
      sheet\n  that could have a future impact in the business such as possible litigation,
      a union\n  threat, etc.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based
      on your\n  scoring in this section, [Company Name] is placed in the lower third
      ranking. While\n  sections such as products and services, customers, and competitors
      are inherently\n  more important to a buyer (because those sections are beyond
      the company’s immediate\n  control), your weak score in this section reflects
      the current, general weakness\n  of [Company Name].</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Assets
      generally have a\n  direct, one-to-one influence on setting price while liabilities
      are the detractors\n  that have a negative influence on EBITDA and the multiplier
      used to establish price.\n  Therefore, we recommend that you look at the various
      items that make up your liabilities,\n  prioritize them according to their impact
      on the wellbeing of your business, and\n  put forth an effort to diminish them.
      Remember, a buyer will not assume your liabilities\n  in an asset sale, and
      with liabilities out of balance, an asset buyer is what you\n  can generally
      expect to attract.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 22:37:33.784958000Z\nupdated_at:

      of or risk\n  of employee related claims against the company. The presence of,
      or the risk of,\n  a union is an obvious value detractor but depending upon
      the region of the country\n  and nature of the union, it could have a varying
      valuation impact.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n  Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>The
      [Company Name] human resource situation is\n  in the lower third. It will be
      perceived as risky and reduces its value. Your employee\n  turnover, age factors
      and overall people situation is in need of repair. The score\n  and data indicate
      that you will be perceived to have fairly poor morale and people\n  problems.
      It is likely that meaningful performance management is absent, policies\n  and
      procedures are not being followed and the handbook is not up to date or evenly\n
      \ applied.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Since the sources of employee
      problems\n  are usually not found in only one area, an objective and complete
      review of the\n  people situation is the best solution. To improve the situation,
      policies and procedures\n  need to be fully reviewed by an objective outsider.
      .The review should include employee\n  manuals, hiring policies, work rules,
      employee goals and objectives and any measurements\n  used in the company. This
      should be augmented by employee interviews and possibly\n  surveys. As a result
      of this process, [Company Name] will need to put policies,\n  procedures and
      practices in place to begin to improve the poor human resource situation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Special\n
      \ review and attention will be needed to reduce or eliminate your risk of litigation\n
      \ and future problems for you or a buyer. It cannot be fixed overnight and several\n
      \ years will be required to show the right diversity, age, turnover and risk
      ratios\n  to insure your human resource issues are not a major value deduction.
      A big risk\n  is that a poor human resource situation will reflect poorly on
      other areas of the\n  business such as sales, products, the management team
      and other value factors resulting\n  in a dramatic value reduction.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      issues. A big risk is that, whether real or perceived, it will become\n  a serious

      An\n  outsider should conduct the review and also interview or survey employees.
      As a\n  result of the review, [Company Name] can fully understand the areas
      that are in\n  need of correction. Focus should be on insuring improvement and
      sustainability in\n  your employee ratios, diversity in the workforce and minimizing
      the turnover of\n  experienced employees. It is likely you have some litigation

      of a union is an obvious\n  value detractor, but depending upon the region of
      the country and nature of the\n  union, it could have a varying valuation impact.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current\n  Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>With a score in the upper one third,
      [Company Name] has a reasonable\n  human resource situation. The company does
      not appear to have a serious morale,\n  turnover or hiring problem.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>The
      employee manual\n  should still be reviewed to insure it is being properly and
      evenly applied. The\n  risk of it not being properly applied could still cause
      a significant value reduction.\n  It also helps to keep it up to date. Care
      should be taken to insure the ratios are\n  maintained. It is also critical
      you properly manage your people as you go through\n  the process sell or otherwise
      change the business.</p>\\r\\n<p>When companies have\n  a good track record
      with people, they often forget the dramatic affect potential\n  change and change
      can have on them. As the owner prepares his or her exit strategy,\n  the employee
      ratios can turn down very quickly. Attention must be given here or\n  it will
      become a last minute value detractor or possible deal breaker.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored below average on this aspect.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Because\n
      \ the main purpose and key to survival of any business is to generate cash,
      the ability\n  for a business to generate cash is usually the single largest
      value driver for a\n  buyer. Although a buyer’s real interest lies in the ability
      of a business to generate\n  future cash flow, historical numbers serve to validate,
      or invalidate, the various\n  assumptions used in the prediction of future cash
      generation.</p>\\r\\n<p>When a business\n  changes hands, it will typically
      continue along on its current trend line until\n  such time that the buyer can
      influence and improve the factors of sales volume,\n  variable cost, and fixed
      cost. This fact is relevant more so for financial buyers\n  than for strategic
      buyers because financial buyers have less ability to affect sales\n  volume
      and costs in the short term, and additional debt service could add to their\n
      \ costs.</p>\\r\\n<p>The slope created by the combined historical and projected
      financial\n  trend lines presents the buyer with a level of either greater or
      lesser financial\n  risk. As they assess a possible acquisition candidate, a
      buyer uses financial risk\n  as one of their major criteria for determining
      what they think the business is worth\n  (the step of assigning value assumes
      the buyer first concludes the business is an\n  acceptable acquisition candidate).
      Remember they only calculate value on 12 months\n  trailing EBITDA, what the
      future holds is their own assessment and they will not\n  include any positive
      value, only any negative or risk in future earnings.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n
      \ Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based on your score in this section, [Company\n
      \ Name] falls into the bottom third ranking compared to where you should be
      in order\n  to attract attention as a possible acquisition candidate. [Company
      Name] lacks a\n  sound financial track record and does not have the basic business
      elements in place\n  that are required in order to convince a buyer that the
      ability for the business\n  to generate cash is just over the horizon. This
      is especially true for a financial\n  buyer because they lack the ability to
      absorb poor financial performance or make\n  quick improvements to turn the
      financial tide.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>In\n  order to be
      considered a possible acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must improve\n  the
      slope of financial risk. This is achieved by creating a minimum of a two-year\n
      \ history of improved cash generation based on specific improvements, such as
      new\n  or modified offerings and/or cost reductions, that can be demonstrated
      to have directly\n  contributed to acceptable and improving cash generation.
      These improvements, along\n  with any additional improvements that perhaps have
      not yet been demonstrated, will\n  then serve to project future cash generation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep
      in mind that any improvement\n  in general economic conditions as a contributing
      factor in your improved cash generation\n  will carry little weight in a buyer’s
      financial risk assessment for [Company Name].\n  We cannot stress enough that
      your improvements must come from positive changes that\n  you make to your business.
      These include who your customers are, what you offer\n  them, how effective
      you are at marketing and selling, the ability to extract higher\n  prices, and
      the costs of the materials and methods used to create your offering.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      financial\n  attributes that would make you highly attractive and allow you
      to realize a high\n  multiple for your business. In other words, assuming you
      do attract the attention\n  of a buyer, your so-so ability to demonstrate historical
      and future cash generation\n  will definitely reduce the value that a buyer
      will assign. In addition to price,\n  it could also have a significant impact
      on other elements of an offer such as the\n  amount of cash paid at closing.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>In
      order to\n  be considered a top-tier acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must
      improve the\n  slope of its financial performance by creating a significant
      upward improvement\n  over a 12-month period. Upward trending financials must
      be based on specific changes\n  made to the business such as new or modified
      offerings, price improvements, cost\n  reductions, enhanced marketing and selling,
      a more loyal and informed customer base,\n  improved competitive advantage,
      etc.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keep in mind that improved general\n  economic conditions will
      carry little weight in a buyer’s financial risk assessment\n  for [Company Name].
      Improved financial performance must come from changes that you\n  make to your
      business &mdash; not from outside economic factors.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-18

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored above average on this aspect.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>When\n
      \ a business changes hands, it will typically continue along on its current
      trend\n  line until such time that the buyer can influence and improve the factors
      of sales\n  volume, variable cost, and fixed cost. This fact is relevant more
      so for financial\n  buyers than for strategic buyers because financial buyers
      have less ability to affect\n  sales volume and costs in the short term, and
      additional debt service could add\n  to their costs.</p>\\r\\n<p>The slope created
      by the combined historical and projected\n  financial trend lines presents the
      buyer with a level of either greater or lesser\n  financial risk. As they assess
      a possible acquisition candidate, a buyer uses financial\n  risk as one of their
      major criteria for assigning a value to what they think the\n  business is worth
      (the step of assigning value assumes the buyer first concludes\n  the business
      is an acceptable acquisition candidate). Remember they only calculate\n  value
      on 12-months trailing EBITDA; what the future holds is their own assessment\n
      \ and they will not include any positive value, only any negative or risk in
      future\n  earnings.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based
      on your score\n  in this section, [Company Name] is in the top third ranking.
      Placement in the top\n  third will definitely help you attract the attention
      of buyers. Your ability to\n  maintain sales and control costs, as indicated
      by strong cash flow throughout the\n  economic downturn, speaks well for the
      overall strength of your business. To a buyer\n  looking at your business, this
      strength allows them to confidently project future\n  cash generation, which
      minimizes their risk and allows them to strengthen any offer\n  they tender.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>While
      your placement in the top\n  third is a clear advantage for you, you would be
      wise to consider ways to further\n  improve EBITDA and strengthen your market
      position. Doing so will improve your chances\n  of receiving an optimized price
      when the time comes for you to sell. Efforts should\n  be focused on further
      increasing customer value, maintaining or even improving your\n  pricing strategies,
      further defining and refining all internal processes including\n  the marketing
      and selling process, and finding additional methods to control and\n  reduce
      your costs. Remember, increased EBITDA will be multiplied into the price\n  offered
      and improved market position will enhance the multiplier</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      \ base and the revenue stream can seriously detract from business valuation.
      Buyers\n  will make this a key area of critical review. Buyers are looking for
      the impact\n  of economic cycles, the risk to the business of losing customers
      or being overly\n  dependent upon risky customers, markets, and sectors. For
      instance, a business highly\n  dependent upon automotive customers who are impacted
      by widely swinging automotive\n  business cycles has a lower value than customers
      in a stable, low variation industry\n  such as a public utility or pharmaceuticals.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another
      big factor for any\n  company is being dependent upon a small number of customers
      that make up a large\n  percentage of your business. It is very risky and if
      a large customer is lost it\n  can have a catastrophic impact on the company.
      The risk of losing a significant\n  customer when transitioning ownership of
      a business is always very high. Many buyers\n  hold the previous owner responsible
      and use earn outs or incentive programs to the\n  seller based upon their commitment
      and ability to keep a customer after a sale.</p>\\r\\n<p>Major\n  consideration
      is also given to diversity of the customer base. A multi-market customer\n  base
      that is financially healthy is less risky than a single vertical market. Value\n
      \ and buyers look for a customer base that allows them to have consistent revenue\n
      \ and sales all year and from year to year. Without this balance, significant
      value\n  is lost.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company
      Name] has\n  a poor customer situation ranking in the lower third of the index.
      The business\n  is very dependent upon customers and markets that put the revenue
      stream at risk.\n  This high-risk customer base will encourage a lower valuation.
      A typical buyer will\n  assume losing business soon after buying the business].
      It will make the valuation\n  lower and even if earn outs and post transaction
      incentives are included in the\n  valuation, they are rarely fully earned by
      a seller. This risk factor is very significant\n  and, as noted, a dramatic
      deduction against EBITDA will be made. The customer situation\n  could simply
      be a deal killer and make the company virtually unsellable.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company\n
      \ Name] should make some customer base changes in order to build value and make
      the\n  company more appealing in the marketplace and to potential buyers. Starting
      with\n  a customer base evaluation, [Company Name] needs to rethink and overhaul
      its business\n  mode, and market strategy. Emphasis should be given to customer
      diversity, market\n  and customer financial health and its sales processes to
      reshape the customer base.\n  This is a long-term issue and may require several
      years to correct in order to lower\n  the risk factor. Sometimes companies tend
      to have an emotional attachment to customers\n  and business models that others
      would quickly change. Be sure to take an objective\n  look at the situation
      (like the buyer will) to get an unemotional view.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19

      looking for the impact\n  of economic cycles, the risk to the business of losing
      customers or being overly\n  dependent upon risky customers, markets, and sectors.
      For instance, a business highly\n  dependent upon automotive customers who are
      impacted by widely swinging automotive\n  business cycles has a lower value
      than customers in a stable, low variation industry\n  such as a public utility
      or pharmaceuticals.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another big factor for any\n  company is being
      dependent upon a small number of customers that make up a large\n  percentage
      of your business. It is very risky and if a large customer is lost it\n  can
      have a catastrophic impact on the company. The risk of losing a significant\n
      \ customer when transitioning ownership of a business is always very high. Many
      buyers\n  hold the previous owner responsible and use earn outs or incentive
      programs to the\n  seller based upon their commitment and ability to keep a
      customer after a sale.</p>\\r\\n<p>Major\n  consideration is also given to diversity
      of the customer base. A multi-market customer\n  base that is financially healthy
      is less risky than a single vertical market. Value\n  and buyers look for a
      customer base that allows them to have consistent revenue\n  and sales all year
      and from year to year. Without this balance, significant value\n  is lost.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company Name] has\n  a middle third ranking
      in its level of risk in its customer base. Although you may\n  consider this
      similar to most companies, in reality there is still risk of losing\n  some
      customers due to the company’s dependence on a higher risk customer situation\n
      \ and markets. The customer base lacks sufficient diversity to value it as a
      solid\n  on-going revenue stream. A buyer will discount revenue and EBITDA for
      some factor\n  of lost sales. As you will recall, this has a significant impact
      on EBITDA and the\n  multiplier. A buyer will assume [Company Name] has an unstable
      revenue trend.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Obviously\n  [Company
      Name] needs to address their revenue risk issues. The business needs to\n  make
      some customer base changes in order to reduce dependence on risky customers,\n
      \ build value and make the company more appealing in the marketplace and to
      potential\n  buyers. You should start with an objective a customer base evaluation.
      [Company\n  Name] needs to rethink its current market strategy and consider
      expanding or diversifying\n  its markets. Emphasis should be given to customer
      diversity, market and customer\n  financial health and its sales processes to
      reshape the customer base. This is a\n  long-term issue and may require several
      years to correct and lower the risk factor.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 21:49:23.783154000Z\nupdated_at:

      business opportunistically\n  for short-term gains, doing so will introduce

      Care should be taken to not take on more risk\n  and destroy value.</p>\\r\\n<p>Going
      forward [Company Name] needs to continually review\n  its customer base to insure
      it maintains diversity and does not become dependent\n  on risky customers.
      A normal product and business life cycle will cause [Company\n  Name] to naturally
      move to a higher risk customer base. Objective and careful monitoring\n  and

      Although\n  your relative size and the growth trends of the markets in which

      environment. Having several\n  competitors and no single dominant competitor

      by one competitor, the growth potential and\n  value are severely limited.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although
      at times it seems counter-intuitive,\n  a market share so small that the company
      lacks critical mass to move forward and\n  grow is a significant problem. It
      is as bad as when one single competitor controls\n  the marketplace. A 15% share
      of served market is an indicator of critical mass in\n  order to grow the business
      while a 65% market share is an indicator the company\n  has limited growth potential
      in the same way a 65% single competitor market share\n  limits the growth opportunity.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      key to market share and growth potential\n  is having a sustainable competitive
      advantage. Buyers will look for this in assessing\n  value. Advantages over
      the competition, which competitors cannot easily duplicate,\n  will be a big
      value driver. When your product or service has no significant advantage\n  your
      revenue is again at risk and your growth potential is more limited. Although\n
      \ past performance is usually a great indicator of value and future value, without\n
      \ clear growth opportunity [Company Name] value will be significantly less than
      past\n  performance would otherwise indicate.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name] Current
      Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>The\n  competitive situation for [Company Name] indicates
      your growth opportunity and current\n  revenue stream are at risk. Your competitive
      index in the lower third indicates\n  that you cannot easily grow or expand
      without significant resources being spent\n  to change or make a market shift
      and assure revenue growth. [Company Name] does\n  not have a clear sustainable
      competitive advantage and is in an environment where\n  the competitors have
      the upper hand. The competitive dynamic must change in order\n  to build business
      value.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>To change the dynamic,\n  [Company
      Name] should start by completing an objective competitive analysis and\n  review
      to identify an alternative competitive approach and possibly your business\n
      \ model. Most companies are functionally in a confrontational competitive situation\n
      \ where there is no real advantage and from time to time each is merely able
      to get\n  an upper hand and sustain it for relatively short periods. The solution
      that delivers\n  value is to identify and pursue a true sustainable competitive
      advantage. Doing\n  so will require a review of the customers and their use
      of the company’s product\n  or service and all the major elements of the company
      to identify where and how to\n  build a competitive advantage.</p>\\r\\n<p>It
      would be worthwhile for [Company Name]\n  to review the five or six primary
      competitive strategies that can be pursued. This\n  will help move the company
      away from the current confrontational strategy and to\n  pursue a gorilla, niching
      or other more effective strategy. In addition some combination\n  of a change
      in your business model, market served or product offering might be necessary\n
      \ to improve your competitive situation.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 21:49:23.825824000Z\nupdated_at:

      \ best way to improve the bottom line is to improve the top line. Since sales
      is the\n  single most important indicator of success, buyers look for companies
      with a robust\n  process to uncover sales leads and convert those leads into
      customers. Buyers like\n  to see a sales process that has been proven effective
      through measured inputs and\n  outputs, and one that is repeatedly followed.
      They also look for processes that\n  are disciplined in maintaining contact
      with current and even past customers in order\n  to secure repeat business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Buyers
      place significant importance on seeing\n  sales spread across many customers
      rather than just a few, and they prefer to see\n  customers from a mixture of
      market sectors rather than a concentration in one or\n  two sectors. The reasons
      for these preferences are obvious &mdash; relying on a\n  few large customers,
      or having all customers grouped in one or two market sectors\n  is like having
      all your eggs in one basket. It presents great risk if a customer\n  or a sector
      goes away.</p>\\r\\n<p>Last but not least, buyers tend to show little\n  interest
      in companies when sales rest on the shoulders of the owner. Buyers understand\n
      \ that once a company is sold, even if the owner agrees to stay on in a sales
      role\n  or through a transition period (which typically do not work out well),
      there is\n  too much risk associated with a sales process based exclusively
      on owner/customer\n  relationships and they will discount for this as lower
      revenue.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n  Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based
      on your scoring in this section, [Company\n  Name] is placed in the lower third
      ranking. Your weak marketing and sales process\n  not only makes [Company Name]
      a less attractive acquisition candidate, it makes\n  you vulnerable to the reality
      of not generating enough sales to sustain your business\n  should one or two
      unexpected internal or external events occur.</p>\\r\\n<p>Being\n  in the lower
      third means any buyer attention would come from a smaller pool. Interested\n
      \ buyers would most likely be strategic buyers such as local competitors trying
      to\n  reduce their competition, or buyers located elsewhere with synergistic
      offerings\n  who would like to expand their capabilities or move into your market
      location. Nevertheless,\n  any offer coming your way could be moderately to
      heavily discounted. It should be\n  expected that an offer from a financial
      buyer would be far more discounted than\n  an offer from a strategic buyer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Unless
      you\n  are aware of a strategic buyer who has expressed a serious interest in
      [Company\n  Name] and/or you have a highly unique offering that has enough value
      to offset your\n  weak marketing and sales process, you face a serious issue
      that requires immediate\n  attention. We suggest that you first prioritize your
      deficiencies. Then make improvements\n  on a prioritized basis. Keep in mind
      that process changes like these require both\n  determination and time to accomplish
      but fortunately, they do not necessarily require\n  capital investment.</p>\"\ncreated_at:

      \ best way to improve the bottom line is to improve the top line. Since sales
      is the\n  single most important indicator of success, buyers look for companies
      with a robust\n  process to uncover sales leads and convert those leads into
      customers. Buyers like\n  to see a sales process that has been proven effective
      through measured inputs and\n  outputs, and one that is repeatedly followed.
      They also look for processes that\n  are disciplined in maintaining contact
      with current and even past customers in order\n  to secure repeat business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Buyers
      place significant importance on seeing\n  sales spread across many customers
      rather than just a few, and they prefer to see\n  customers from a mixture of
      market sectors rather than a concentration in one or\n  two sectors. The reasons
      for these preferences are obvious &mdash; relying on a\n  few large customers,
      or having all customers grouped in one or two market sectors\n  is like having
      all your eggs in one basket. It presents great risk if a customer\n  or a sector
      goes away.</p>\\r\\n<p>Last but not least, buyers tend to show little\n  interest
      in companies when sales rest on the shoulders of the owner. Buyers understand\n
      \ that once a company is sold, even if the owner agrees to stay on in a sales
      role\n  or through a transition period (which typically do not work out well),
      there is\n  too much risk associated with a sales process based exclusively
      on owner/customer\n  relationships and they will discount for this as lower
      revenue.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company\n  Name] Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Based
      on your score in this section, [Company\n  Name] falls into the middle third
      ranking. This will reduce buyer valuation and\n  interest in [Company Name].
      This is especially true for the pool of financial buyers\n  because they are
      more reliant on a robust, well-balanced process to generate sales.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although\n
      \ a weak marketing and sales process can be somewhat less important to a strategic\n
      \ buyer because they often have the ability to more quickly shore-up deficiencies\n
      \ in the process, they will still lower the value because they have to invest
      in it\n  and know others will discount as well. Remember, the pool of strategic
      buyers is\n  generally smaller than the financial buyer pool.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Because\n
      \ [Company Name] already has some of the essential elements of an acceptable
      marketing\n  and sales process, you would not be required to start over or make
      large structural\n  changes to the process. However, we suggest that you make
      a concerted effort to\n  improve the process. You will likely need a segmentation
      analysis and an objective\n  look at your sales process. Although you may have
      some sales talent, this ranking\n  indicates you may not have a robust process.
      Prioritize your deficiencies and then\n  make improvements on a prioritized
      basis. Keep in mind that process changes like\n  these require both determination
      and time to accomplish but fortunately, they do\n  not necessarily require capital
      investment.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 22:16:34.214903000Z\nupdated_at: 2012-02-03

      on your score in this section, [Company\n  Name] is in the top third ranking,

      up a greater number of financial buyers who rely on an inherently\n  strong
      marketing and sales process on the day they take over the business. You should\n
      \ not see a significant value reduction for sales and marketing.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>Because\n
      \ the marketing and sales process is quite important to buyers, we recommend
      you continue\n  to fine-tune your process. Work on measuring the effectiveness
      of [Company Name]\n  to uncover leads and effectively convert them to active
      customers. Make adjustments\n  where opportunities exist. Remember that your
      sales price is some multiple of the\n  cash you are generating, and nothing
      generates cash faster that improving sales.\n  Therefore, your efforts to improve
      this process should pay you back multiple times.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19

      ! \"<p class=\\\"section-status\\\">You scored low on this section.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\r\\n<p>Business\n
      \ valuation for [Company Name] is directly related to the ability of the business\n
      \ to run without the owner. This does not mean for a day or a week but forever
      after\n  the owner is gone. As the owner, if you leave the company for three
      months and it\n  can continue to perform just as well without your involvement
      in that three-month\n  period as it would have if you were involved, you can
      achieve reasonable value.</p>\\r\\n<p>Unfortunately,\n  other factors relating
      to the abilities and capabilities of your management team\n  and key employees
      can potentially be significant value detractors from [Company\n  Name]. Key
      among them is the longevity and runway ahead of your management team.\n  Clearly,
      buying a business with experienced management that are all planning to\n  retire
      in the next few years is just as risky as an inexperienced team. Business\n
      \ value comes from that perfect balance of age, experience and ability.</p>\\r\\n<p>Management\n
      \ must also be committed to [Company Name]; otherwise the situation is considered\n
      \ dangerous and risky. A buyer will want them committed to contracts that include\n
      \ non-competes and limit the risk of trade secrets being exposed, competitors
      hiring\n  your people, or key employees who become competitors themselves. In
      some severe\n  situations where it is likely management will leave and become
      competitors after\n  an ownership change, the business value will be zero. The
      risk will be judged too\n  high.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another key value factor for [Company
      Name] is the level of tribal\n  knowledge. Although we all value employees who
      know what they are doing, we do not\n  want to have to depend on them as the
      only ones who know how to do things. Documented\n  process for doing things
      in the business is another major value driver. In this\n  way there is little
      risk should you lose a key employee. Buyers focus heavily on\n  this documentation
      and consider a business reliant on key people and lacking documentation\n  of
      key processes as very risky. They will make a big discount of value for these\n
      \ factors. It does not matter if it is a strategic or financial buyer; both
      will need\n  the same confidence in management, people and commitment. The only
      difference is\n  the length of time they need them.</p>\\r\\n<h2>[Company Name]
      Current Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Like\n  many privately held businesses [Company
      Name] has a level of owner involvement and\n  dependence that is very high placing
      them in the lower third on the index. Although\n  it may feel like the company
      has a good team and has delegated tasks to them, the\n  owner is still very
      involved in daily activities and the business cannot stand on\n  its own without
      them and without some key employees. The processes of [Company Name]\n  are
      not well enough documented to ensure the business can continue to run well.\n
      \ This limits value in that a new owner may not be able to step in and be successful\n
      \ right away. A potential buyer will need significant time and money to replace
      what\n  the owner knows. Further, this reflects badly on the [Company Name]
      management team\n  indicating they are not the reliable team to carry the business
      forward, which translates\n  to even more risk for the buyer.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>An
      objective,\n  critical evaluation of the [Company Name] management team, internal
      processes and\n  documentation is necessary to move forward. A full review considering
      longevity,\n  runway for the team, the level of process documentation and your
      employment contracts\n  and agreements is necessary. This review may take as
      much as two to three years\n  to maximize the value of the management team.
      Keep in mind, the balance of longevity\n  and runway are both important so presenting
      a business with a young management team\n  and six months experience may reduce
      value as much or even more than a team with\n  little runway.</p>\\r\\n<p>If
      and when [Company Name] goes on the market, the business\n  and management team
      will face a completely new set of issues. Both the business\n  and management
      will be spotlighted and intensely evaluated. Care should be taken\n  to secure
      the management team with stay packages through the sale process as well\n  as
      good coaching provided by experienced people so they can hold up well and properly\n
      \ show their capabilities and abilities to a buyer.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19

      Position</h2>\\r\\n<p>Although\n  the [Company Name] can run without the owner
      for periods of time, it is still very\n  dependent upon a one or two people
      for success. While this level of owner involvement\n  is common for owner-led
      businesses, it is still a value reduction. With only some\n  processes documented,
      [Company Name] needs to document more in order to insure it\n  is not too dependent
      on key employees and can still serve all customers well without\n  them. Just
      the same, a new owner will still view the purchase of [Company Name]\n  as risky
      due to this dependence on the owner and key people and will discount significantly\n
      \ for all the cost of building documentation and risk associated with not having
      it.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company\n  Name] needs to review
      and consider improvement in the management team. There are\n  issues relating
      to their capability, commitment and runway. The company needs to\n  insure they
      have tight employment agreements keeping them from becoming competitors\n  to
      a new owner and perhaps have good reasons to stay with them. Money spent to
      insure\n  your management team is tied up should also include stay packages
      for transition.\n  Once you document your processes and reduce dependence upon
      the owner, what you\n  spend will be returned to you in a much higher business
      valuation. If and when [Company\n  Name] goes on the market, the business and
      management team will face a completely\n  new set of issues. Both will be spotlighted
      and intensely evaluated. Care should\n  be taken to prepare the management team
      for the sale process as well as good coaching\n  provided by experienced people
      so they can hold up well and properly show their\n  capabilities and abilities

      without the owner’s direct daily involvement.\n  It also indicates you have
      a management team that is capable and reliable and uses\n  documented processes.
      Be sure to look at their runway and commitment to the business.\n  As capable
      as they may be, it also could put [Company Name] or a new owner at risk\n  of
      key people joining or becoming competitors unless your employment and non-compete\n
      \ agreements are tight and will hold up under scrutiny.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\\r\\n<p>It\n
      \ also is important to make certain that your employment agreements are not
      too costly\n  to terminate should a buyer wish to get out of an agreement at
      a reasonable cost\n  in the future. It would be normal for a buyer to discount
      the cost of terminating\n  an employment agreement from EBITDA and lower the
      purchase price significantly.\n  If and when [Company Name] goes on the market
      and is put up for sale, the business\n  and management team will face a completely
      new set of issues. Both the business\n  and management will be spotlighted and
      intensely evaluated. Care should be taken\n  to secure the management team through
      the sale process with stay packages, training\n  and good coaching provided
      by experienced people so they can hold up well and properly\n  show their capabilities
      and abilities to a buyer.</p>\"\ncreated_at: 2012-01-19 22:16:34.349010000Z\nupdated_at:

      should be augmented by employee interviews and possibly\n  surveys. As a result

      Your\n  business model is the formula you use to outsmart your competitors,
      provide ongoing\n  value to customers, and continually grow your business. There
      are eight essential\n  areas to a business model:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must

      graceful\n  exit</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Must avoid pitfalls</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Not
      all the areas carry\n  an equal weight. As you can see from the graph of the
      section weighs below, the\n  combination of excellent margins plus an easy to
      sell product account for over one\n  half of the total score. Significant research
      has gone into this scoring process\n  to assess your business model with the
      greatest accuracy. Remember that your competitors\n  are actively working to
      improve there competitive position and therefore business\n  models erode over
      time. No matter what your score, your best source of competitive\n  advantage
      is to be continually actively working to refine and improve your business\n

      /></p>\\r\\n<p>In the past,\n  you may not have given much thought to your business
      model. Most business books\n  teach us that our business plan is the most important
      tool for managing our business\n  success. However, a stellar business plan
      is not much good without a solid business\n  model behind it.</p>\\r\\n<div

      \ style=\\\"color: #177cbf; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-align:
      center;\\\">Average\n  business plan + great business model = a great business</div>\\r\\n<p>Previously,\n
      \ there were no objective criteria for gauging the quality of a business model.
      Venture\n  capitalists and bankers had been judging business models for years,
      but on subjective,\n  gut impressions. Our model uses a scientific, objective
      approach to grading an existing\n  business model.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are still
      not sold on the importance of your business\n  model, ponder this: all business
      models will go stale if unaltered. Typically, this\n  process takes ten to twenty
      years. Here are some examples:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blockbuster\n  video
      made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in the 1990’s and commanded\n
      \ a 90% market share. Today it is nearly defunct.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IBM has successfully\n
      \ morphed its business model several times over the years in order to remain
      successful\n  vs. Xerox and Kodak who have not.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Radio stations
      were a profitable\n  cash cow for decades until iPods came along.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If
      you were Wal-Mart\n  in the 1990s, would you have figured that your biggest
      competitor would be Amazon.com?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>For\n  many retailers, the

      matter what business you are\n  in, there are times when borrowing money makes
      good financial sense. Trying to finance\n  growth internally presents challenges
      and restrictions to most companies especially\n  when upfront investment is
      required, and the proper capital structure and working\n  capital support are
      not in place.</p>\\r\\n<p>Even if you are not contemplating a\n  loan, bankers
      are merely very cautious investors who only invest in strong companies\n  that
      are well run. For this reason, the Bankability Index is actually a report card\n
      \ on the strength of [Company Name] and its ability to generate an attractive
      ROI.\n  For this reason, it is highly instructive for you as CEO to know how
      bankable [Company\n  Nickname] is and also things you might do to improve.</p>\\r\\n<p>The
      first step for\n  [Company Nickname] to apply for a loan will be to present
      your bank with a comprehensive\n  overview of your business by providing them
      with a business plan that gives them\n  a full strategic understanding of you
      and [Company Nickname]. The business plan\n  will need to address any challenges
      that you and the company are facing and a plan\n  of how you are meeting them
      - now and in the next couple of years.</p>\\r\\n<p>It\n  is useful to the bank,
      if not required, to provide a detailed explanation of the\n  purpose of the
      loan. This could for example be an outline of how the purchase of\n  additional
      equipment would enhance revenues, efficiencies and profitably. You should\n
      \ include relevant information such as purchasing contract details outlining
      delivered\n  and installed price, capital expenditure justification studies
      and projected timelines.\n  An integral part of the information will be a schedule
      detailing the projected cash-flow\n  and draws against the desired loan for
      [Company Nickname].</p>\\r\\n<p>You will be\n  required to provide a full set
      of financial reports, which will include at least\n  the most recent balance
      sheet and income statements for [Company Nickname] as well\n  as any notes that
      would provide them with a clear understanding of the company’s\n  financial
      condition. Most banks prefer at least 2 trading year’s worth of financials\n
      \ and will not even consider any company that cannot provide this. A bank loan
      is\n  highly unlikely if you have not been in business for more than 2 years.
      This information\n  will allow the bank to gain a proper understanding of recent
      trends within your\n  business. Personal financial information is increasingly
      being used to supplement\n  the company’s information. So you will likely be
      required to provide your FICO score\n  and full personal financial reports.</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      perennial problem with small businesses\n  is the fact that owners generally
      see it as an accepted benefit to run personal\n  expenses through the business.
      The owner’s salary is an acceptable business expense\n  as long as they are
      active in the running of the business, it is justifiable. Whatever\n  the Taxman
      does or does not allow beyond this is largely irrelevant to an investor\n  except
      to the extent that it might detract from the business. An investor is really\n
      \ only concerned with the actual ability of the business to generate an acceptable\n
      \ return. Strictly speaking, the strongest P&amp;L will be one that has been
      &amp;Normalized&amp;\n  by taking out all discretionary and extra-ordinary personal
      income benefits and\n  expenses that the owner draws or puts through the business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Banks
      all\n  take different approaches to establish lending criteria, which are commonly
      called\n  &amp;Loan Covenants&amp;. Most of the criteria that are used rely
      on analysis of\n  the borrowing company’s recent financial statements to determine
      their financial\n  strength and performance. If [Company Nickname] is felt to
      present an acceptable\n  risk to the bank, the loan is made. If not, there is
      generally no explanation given.\n  Lenders know they must take risks, but they
      don’t want those risks made known so\n  when a loan application is declined,
      the applicant is left wondering what happened!\n  You are no further forward
      and obviously could still use a loan to move your business\n  forward. This
      all begs the question of: what [Company Nickname] would need to do\n  to position
      the business to be an acceptable risk and qualify for a loan.</p>\\r\\n<p>Factors\n
      \ taken into consideration by the banks are:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Liquidity
      and stability</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Equity</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Debt\n  and Leverage</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Cash
      Flow and receivables</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Other investments</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Capital\n
      \ structure</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Distributions</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Various pieces of
      non-financial\n  data</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Banking conditions have changed
      significantly over the\n  last 10 years and banks are now subject to far more
      rigorous restrictions than previously\n  seen. Consequently loans are far harder
      to get and many banks are simply unable\n  or unwilling to lend at this time.
      Loan agreements contain covenants &ndash; conditions\n  that the borrower must
      meet in order to get a loan and stay financed. Lending criteria\n  have shifted
      as a consequence of changes in the borrowing patterns and covenants\n  are not
      only different but far more stringent than in years past.</p>\\r\\n<p>For\n
      \ instance, reduced personal equity on the part of small business owners is
      endemic,\n  which makes the need for borrowing more critical than ever, but
      makes loans far\n  more difficult to get. Banks increasingly have to take account
      of non-financial\n  data to gain comfort that you and [Company Nickname] are
      an acceptable risk.</p>\\r\\n<p>CEO\n  Focus has constructed a program that
      utilizes proprietary algorithms to evaluate\n  both financial and non-financial
      information to calculate the company’s Bankability\n  Index&trade;. The program
      is continually calibrated against data drawn from businesses\n  across the USA
      and gives powerful insight into your chances of getting a loan and\n  what [Company
      Nickname] can do to improve their Bankability Index.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Lending\n
      \ Criteria</h2>\\r\\n<p>In general, banks that take a more restrictive approach
      to lending\n  are more likely to set tighter covenants and be less forgiving
      of borrower deviations\n  and violations. Banks that set covenants in conjunction
      with the borrower are more\n  flexible on their terms. Banks are increasingly
      looking at the business owner’s\n  FICO score and financial statements as a
      measure of how responsibly they conduct\n  their personal financial affairs.
      They want the borrower to be part of setting the\n  covenants, so that they
      will be less likely to deviate from or violate them. Smaller\n  banks generally
      fall into this category but some larger banks operate this way too,\n  which
      is why it is important to have a good relationship with your banker. Many\n
      \ of the larger banks have been accused of moving loan officers and bank managers\n
      \ regularly to prevent a strong relationship from being established.</p>\\r\\n<p>The\n
      \ aim of covenants is to protect the bank from default on the part of the borrower\n
      \ but also to provide clear and reasonable parameters and actions up front,
      which\n  govern default conditions and remedial actions. Most loan documents
      contain at least\n  2 conditions of default that could be extremely serious
      for the borrower. There\n  are 3 factors in play:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>To
      establish that [Company Nickname]\n  has the ability to repay the loan</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>To
      provide a means to appropriately\n  revisit that assumption during the life
      of the loan</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>To provide remedies\n  if the Bank feels at any
      stage that the loan is insecure as a result of changes\n  in [Company Name]
      or an adverse event affecting your financial condition.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>[Company\n
      \ Nickname] needs to bear in mind that there are factors that may be outside
      of your\n  control but that could still negatively impact your loan:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Change\n
      \ in account officer: the bank may at any time replace the officer administering
      the\n  loan. Should there be a significant difference in approach, personality
      conflict\n  or any misunderstanding; the new officer may deem the bank’s position
      to be insecure.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Bank\n  Policy Changes: mergers, acquisitions
      or changes in banking regulations can lead\n  to changes in the loan conditions.
      [Company Nickname] has no assurances that the\n  lending bank will continue
      to provide credit to them or even any company in their\n  industry.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Properly
      set covenants provide a clear framework of\n  parameters to [Company Nickname]
      and a schedule of review and adjustment (probably\n  annually) that is designed
      to protect the lender from borrower meltdown and provide\n  them comfort that
      the loan is secure. [Company Nickname] and your comfort comes\n  from the knowledge
      that as long as you both abide by the covenants and work with\n  the bank, your
      loan will most likely continue to be entertained by the bank.</p>\\r\\n<h2>The\n
      \ Anatomy of a Loan Agreement</h2>\\r\\n<p>In the past small and medium sized
      companies\n  rarely had the option or opportunity to negotiate commercial loan
      agreements with\n  the lender. The banks dictated the terms and standard agreements
      were used, thereby\n  eliminating the need for referral to higher authority
      and cost to both the bank\n  and the borrower of hiring counsel to evaluate
      or negotiate the terms. In most instances\n  loans were paid off without ever
      having to refer to the fine print.</p>\\r\\n<p>However\n  while still unusual,
      it is becoming more prevalent that borrowers are putting their\n  banks standard
      loan conditions through close scrutiny to identify terms that would\n  be detrimental
      or and undue burden to [Company Nickname]. You will generally not\n  be allowed
      to negotiate the terms of their standard agreement, but it never hurts\n  to
      ask. In the event that this is allowed and you find something worth fighting\n
      \ for (like an unduly onerous penalty interest rate), there is a down side that
      you\n  need to be aware of. The bank would need to retain counsel to cover their
      position\n  and to negotiate any changes to the standard loan terms and conditions.
      In general\n  these costs would be passed directly on to [Company Nickname],
      and they will not\n  come cheap! So while due diligence is vital, it is important
      to keep any negotiations\n  to a minimum while ensuring that [Company Name]
      has the best deal possible.</p>\\r\\n<p>Regardless\n  of whether the bank or
      [Company Nickname] retains counsel or not, you should make\n  sure that the
      following aspects are well taken care of:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t3.1\n
      \ Scope. Most loan agreements contains the following sections:\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.1\n
      \ Statement of the loan terms,</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.2 Warranties and representations\n
      \ about [Company Name], its properties and its operations,</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.3\n
      \ Covenants which may be affirmative (things [Company Nickname] is required
      to comply\n  with), negative (things you may not do) and financial (financial
      performance criteria\n  which will be monitored by the bank to determine continued
      financial wellbeing),\n  and</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.1.4 Events of default.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t3.2\n
      \ Loan Terms. The loan terms that should be reviewed are:\\r\\n\\t\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.1\n
      \ Stated Rate of Interest. Is this reasonable in terms of the financial condition\n
      \ and strength of [Company Nickname]?</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.2 Default Rate
      of Interest.\n  Is the default rate reasonable? (2% over the stated rate is
      the norm)? Under what\n  conditions is the default rate levied? Payment default
      or any default? Will [Company\n  Name] be notified or will it automatically
      become activated while the default persists?\n  And is it in addition to, or
      in lieu of, late payment charges (which may be subject\n  to specific conditions
      and limitations depending of applicable State Laws).</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.3\n
      \ Due Dates of Payments. Is the interest on the loan pre-computed? If not, will
      [Company\n  Nickname] get an interest statement from the lender in time to make
      the monthly\n  payment of interest?</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.4 Prepayments.
      Do the loan documents\n  permit prepayments without penalty?</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>3.2.5
      Attorney's Fees. [Company\n  Name] will generally be required to pay the bank's
      collection costs, including its\n  attorneys' fees and expenses. Many lenders
      standard terms levy fees based on a percentage\n  of the outstanding loan amount.
      This can often far exceed the reasonable cost based\n  on hourly rates.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.3
      Warranties and Representations.\n  These are conditions binding [Company Nickname].
      Most relate to the legal status\n  of [Company Name] and its ability to enter
      into the loan transaction. Others relate\n  to enforceability of the loan conditions
      to [Company Nickname]. All of these should\n  be reviewed to determine if they
      are relevant to the bank's underwriting of the\n  loan. Violation of warranty
      or representation conditions are generally grounds for\n  the lender to invoke
      default remedies under the loan conditions, which include the\n  suspension
      of any pending advances or facilities.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.4 Covenants. The\n
      \ type and nature of the required covenants will most likely depend on the size
      and\n  policies of the bank, and the size, duration and type of loan. The covenants
      should\n  be reviewed to make sure that [Company Nickname] current and anticipated
      operations\n  are likely to meet the covenants. Financial and information reporting
      requirements\n  should be reviewed with management, financial and accounting
      officers to make sure\n  that the company is capable of reasonably producing
      the reports and required information\n  in a timely manner. It should be ensured
      that any financial covenants or reporting\n  are in line with your accounting
      practices.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.5 Defaults. The list\n  of defaults warrants close
      scrutiny and is worth spending considerable time on.\n  The list of defaults
      provides the bank with the conditions under which it may terminate\n  its lending
      relationship with [Company Name] and demand immediate repayment of the\n  loan.
      Care should be taken to understand these conditions and to ensure that unintentional\n
      \ conditions will not trigger a reaction form the lender without the opportunity
      of\n  redress within a reasonable grace period. Generally these relate to missed
      payment\n  deadlines and banks are more open to working with borrowers now than
      they might\n  have previously been, but may put a limit on the number of late
      notices they will\n  tolerate before taking action.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>3.6 Maintaining
      a Good Relationship.\n  Any decisions relating to considerations, consents or
      waivers of covenant defaults\n  will depend heavily on [Company Nickname] relationship
      with the lender. That relationship\n  is built at the time of granting the loan
      so can materially affect the loan rates.\n  Since this relationship continues
      over the life of the loan through the review process,\n  a good relationship
      between you and your banker is critical since your banker is\n  your most powerful
      and worthwhile ally.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Covenent Categories\n  Commonly
      Used by Bands</h2>\\r\\n<p>[Company Name] Balance Sheet and Income Statements\n
      \ will give you most of what will be needed to determine a complete financial
      picture\n  of [Company Nickname]. Now often business owners run different sets
      of books &ndash;\n  one for the IRS, one for the banker and one for the owner
      to know what is actually\n  going on. The difficulty comes in that you cannot
      fool all of the people all of\n  the time and the worst possible person to kid,
      is yourself! This is closely followed\n  by your banker since if you are going
      to have an extended relationship with your\n  banker they will probably pick
      up on inconsistent details and start to ask pointed\n  questions about [Company
      Nickname], quite probably at the time that you would least\n  like them to be
      doing so.</p>\\r\\n<p>Financial ratios are commonly used to measure\n  businesses
      against common criteria. Ratios would look at specific aspects of [Company\n
      \ Nickname] in relationship to others to gain an understanding and measure of
      [Company\n  Nickname]'s strength or weakness in specific areas. Ratios can be
      used to quickly\n  and simply compare companies of different size and industries
      by:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Tracking\n  ratios for [Company Nickname] across
      a number of trading periods,</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Comparing\n  [Company Nickname]'s
      ratios to those of other companies or industry norms</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Showing\n
      \ if projected scenarios and business plans are likely to be successful.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>These\n
      \ are some of the ratios and parameters that banks might use to measure [Company
      Nickname]\n  performance in evaluating your loan application as well as to track
      it after the\n  loan has been granted.</p>\\r\\n<p>Each lender will have their
      own preferences but\n  many parameters are less impactful on the overall score
      and only really come into\n  play in marginal cases or when the finer details
      of a loan are being discussed with\n  your banker. However it is useful to know
      the commonly used characteristics and\n  their associated ratios that your bank
      might consider in evaluating your loan application.\n  These are listed in this
      section.</p>\\r\\n<p>CEO Focus has worked with a range of\n  lenders across
      the country to distill the essence of these ratios in order to provide\n  a
      simpler yet adequately accurate indication of [Company Name]’s probability of\n
      \ getting the desired loan based on the information provided.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t\\t4.1\n

      \ Equity &ndash; Usually covenants require a minimum level of equity in [Company
      Name].\n  Felt by bankers to be important in the meltdown environment &ndash;
      however hard\n  to quantify since small business owners generally no longer
      have the kind of equity\n  that they once did and are relying on loans to fund/carry

      Model</h2>\\r\\n<p>The\n  model is constructed around a Weighted Scorecard utilizing
      merits and de-merits.\n  Scoring and weighting for each ratio input will be
      based on criteria used by the\n  banks, conventional wisdoms and industry averages.
      Thresholds, break points, coefficients\n  and weighting values are based in
      theory and best practices, however because of\n  the difficulty associated providing
      a comprehensive theoretical basis, modifiers\n  are applied on an empirical
      basis. Adjustments are made to account for market and\n  economic shifts and
      trends as the model is tested and calibrated.</p>\\r\\n<p>Commentary\n  for
      [Company Name] will be provided based on the final weighted score for each category\n
      \ relative to various performance brackets. Where necessary, cross correlation

      ! \"<p>The purpose of this Salability Index is to provide [Company\n  Name]
      with an approximation of how a buyer will view your company as a candidate\n
      \ for acquisition. It is a method to quantify the various elements of your business\n
      \ that a buyer would examine in order to formulate a sense of value. It is not
      a valuation\n  method to establish price but it is an estimate of where you
      are likely to finish\n  in the process of selling your business, if you were
      to sell it today in its current\n  condition.</p>\\r\\n<p>The scoring results
      of [Company Name] are provided by section.\n  Each section represents a certain
      aspect of your business that will be evaluated\n  by a buyer (such as financial
      results, products, customers, etc.). Within each section,\n  an explanation
      of your ranking and recommendations are provided.</p>\\r\\n<p>The following\n
      \ table Illustrates the comparative ranking, expressed as a percentage score,
      that\n  [Company Name] achieved for each of the nine index sections:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Financial\n
      \ Results and Future Projections</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Products and Services</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Customers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Competitors</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Marketing\n
      \ and Sales Process</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Management and Key Employees</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Assets\n
      \ and Liabilities</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Human Resources</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Other Considerations</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>The\n
      \ section titled &quot;Other Considerations&quot; is made up of the results
      [Company\n  Name] obtained for the Bankability Index and Business Model Score.
      Since they play\n  a significant role in the eyes of a buyer, they are considered
      a second time and\n  included in this index.</p>\\r\\n<h2>How Business Value
      is determined</h2>\\r\\n<p>Business\n  valuation is market driven. The valuation
      process is ultimately what a buyer will\n  pay for a business and the price
      at which a seller will sell the business. Although\n  this process is very similar
      to the valuation process used when buying a house,\n  it is more closely aligned
      with buying commercial real estate. Think of earnings\n  potential as commercial
      rent. The cost and ability to maintain rental income includes\n  factors like
      location, ability to secure new tenants, the cost to keep the building\n  in
      compliance with existing statutes, rate escalators and the costs associated
      with\n  tenant retention. A buyer will consider these factors to determine the
      potential\n  return on their investment. A buyer will consider the earnings
      potential of the\n  business and their ability to increase its value. They look
      at what they have to\n  spend in order to grow and improve the business.</p>\\r\\n<p>To
      continue our comparison\n  of business value to commercial real estate value,
      the prime consideration is the\n  ability of the business to generate cash.
      A buyer will measure the ability of the\n  business to generate cash by using
      financial reports to determine the last 12 months\n  earnings before interest,
      taxes, depreciation and amortization commonly referred\n  to as EBITDA. The
      seller will need to adjust EBITDA by removing any discretionary\n  expenses
      the owner might charge to the business that others may see as earnings.\n  Typical
      expenses in this category would be life insurance, company vehicles and\n  expense
      accounts. This is commonly referred to as &quot;Adjusted EBITDA&quot; or\n  &quot;Normalized
      EBITDA&quot; but for our discussions here, we will simply call\n  it EBITDA.
      Although EBITDA is not the only determinant of value, it is a significant\n
      \ factor in the equation and it has a profound impact on the buyer’s view of
      the business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Once\n  EBITDA has been established, a value multiplier
      is determined. The multiplier is\n  market driven and generally based on comparisons
      with known entities of similar\n  size in similar markets. Multipliers can vary
      based upon market factors such as\n  the glamor of the business, the markets/industries
      in which they compete, their\n  ability to get financing including the interest
      rate, or in the case of a strategic\n  buyer their internal cost of funds and
      rate of return requirements as well as synergistic\n  earnings potential (hurdle
      rate). In addition, other factors that impact multipliers\n  are the size of
      the business, whether critical skills are vested in the current\n  owner and
      the cost of completing the sale.</p>\\r\\n<p>As mentioned above, multipliers\n
      \ can vary widely. For example, a typical industrial manufacturer or service
      company\n  may be valued at a 5-times multiplier, while a medical company may
      be a 10 or 12-times\n  multiplier because its markets are more robust and affected
      less by business cycles.\n  The size of a business can also be a factor in determining
      the multiplier. Comparable\n  businesses with 12 months trailing EBITDA of $2
      million may get a 4-times multiplier\n  while one with over $5 million EBITDA
      may get an 8-times multiplier.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"center\\\"><img\n  src=\\\"/uploads/picture/image/1328541684939082.png\\\"
      alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Sellability\\\"\n  /></p>\\r\\n<p>Although these numbers
      and this approach may sound appealing at first,\n  they are only a starting
      point for valuation. The reality of valuation is in the\n  weaknesses of the
      business and the risk factors those weaknesses present to the\n  buyer &mdash;
      commonly called ‘value detractors’. Risk factors can take a business\n  with
      a relatively high multiplier to a very low valuation because of the buyer’s\n
      \ perceived risk. They can reduce value by as much as 90% or completely kill
      a deal.\n  Deals are killed every day due to risk factors.</p>\\r\\n<p>It is
      important for owners\n  to understand what buyers look for when evaluating an
      acquisition. Owners must also\n  understand they cannot cover up weaknesses.
      Buyers usually find the problems even\n  when the owner does not know or acknowledge
      them. It is not unusual for a seller\n  to hide problems from a buyer only to
      find themselves in litigation after the sale\n  and losing much of what they
      made in the transaction. Because problems can have\n  a profound effect on value,
      it is important to resolve problems before putting the\n  business up for sale,
      and finding and resolving problems may take several years\n  of work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Generally
      when taking these value reductions, a buyer will reduce\n  EBITDA to reflect
      the risk and what revenues they feel the business is likely to\n  generate in
      the near future. For instance, if it will cost $25,000.00 to fix the\n  problem,
      the buyer will deduct that amount from EBITDA. Or, if a buyer feels revenue\n
      \ is going to decrease by 10%, they will deduct 10% from revenue and adjust
      EBITDA\n  for the impact of the lower revenue. In most cases, a 10% revenue
      reduction will\n  equate to 20% or 30% EBITDA reduction.</p>\\r\\n<p>The most
      significant value reduction\n  comes from the EBITDA multiplier’s impact on
      the sales price If we are looking at\n  a 5-times multiplier and a $20,000 reduction
      in EBITDA, the problem will magnify\n  to $100,000. This means it is well worthwhile
      to fix the problem before putting\n  the business up for sale. The dollars and
      effort put into fixing problems ahead\n  of time will yield the significantly
      improved sales price (EBITDA increase times\n  the multiplier).</p>\\r\\n<p>A
      simplified look at valuing a business is as follows:</p>\\r\\n<p\n  style=\\\"text-align:
      center; text-style: italic;\\\">(Trailing 12 Month Adjusted EBITDA\n  - Risk
      Factors) x Multiplier = Business Value</p>\\r\\n<p>Clearly, a business owner\n
      \ should understand their adjusted EBITDA, and before they embark on the process
      of\n  putting their business up for sale, they should ensure that they have
      a realistic\n  sense for their risk factors, and the multiplier a buyer could
      likely use to value\n  the business. The following chart illustrates the effect
      of a trailing 12-month\n  EBITDA minus risk factors of $500,000. Note the improving
      Business Value Index with\n  increasing industry multipliers.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size:
      9px; text-align: center;\n  text-style: bold;\\\">Business Value Index</p>\\r\\n<!--
      trailing ebitda minus risk\n  factors image -->\\r\\n<p>This salability index
      provides an evaluation of those factors\n  in a business that adds to or reduces
      risk and increases or decreases the multiplier.\n  It then creates a factor
      that is indicative of the current problems (risks) and\n  how they would affect
      value in the eyes of a buyer. It also provides some suggestions\n  of how to
      fix or improve problems and increase value.</p>\"\ncover_page: !!null \nid:

      website is the front\n  door to your company. It needs to properly reflect the
      image and culture of your\n  company. This section will assess the impression
      your website makes on a potential\n  customer as well as what you can do to
      improve.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Social Media</h2>\\r\\n<p>Many\n  business owners feel
      that social media is a waste of time. However, social media\n  is here to stay.
      Whether your customers are using Facebook for business, they are\n  using Facebook
      at home. Not all of your customers are using twitter, but some of\n  them are.
      And whether you like it or not people are checking out you, your company,\n
      \ and your reputation one LinkedIn. Therefore, social media management needs
      to be\n  part of your reputation management strategy even if it is not part
      of your lead\n  generation strategy.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Search Engines</h2>\\r\\n<p>Search
      engine placement\n  is an important component of every businesses lead generation
      strategy. Even if\n  your customers are not Googling to buy products, they are
      Googling to find out related\n  information about your products and your competitors
      products. Being on the first\n  page of Google for your most important terms
      is vital to your lead generation strategy.\n  This section will assess how well
      you are doing in the area of search engine optimization\n  (SEO).</p>\\r\\n<h2>Technical</h2>\\r\\n<p>The
      final section of the website assessment\n  will assess the technical elements
      of your website. This detailed report will analyze\n  the inner workings of
      your website and provide very specific improvement opportunities.\n  The recommendations
      in this section may seem overwhelming. Not all of the recommendations\n  may
      be important for your website. However, virtually all recommendations will improve\n

      service, and retain customers.&quot; &mdash; Jim Muehlhausen, Author &quot;The
      51 Fatal Business Errors and How to Avoid Them&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Your business
      model is your secret sauce. Your model is what makes your business unique. Your
      business model is the formula you use to outsmart your competitors, provide
      ongoing value to customers, and continually grow your business. There are eight
      essential areas to a business model:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Must have excellent
      margins</li>\r\n\t<li>Must be easy to sell</li>\r\n\t<li>Must have The Four
      Capitals&copy;: Intellectual Capital, Financial Capital, Human Capital and Brand
      Capital</li>\r\n\t<li>Must be able to maintain ongoing competitive advantage</li>\r\n\t<li>Must
      have quality customers</li>\r\n\t<li>Must have longevity of the industry</li>\r\n\t<li>Must
      provide for the owner’s graceful exit</li>\r\n\t<li>Must avoid pitfalls</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Not
      all the areas carry an equal weight. As you can see from the graph of the section
      weighs below, the combination of excellent margins plus an easy to sell product
      account for over one half of the total score. Significant research has gone
      into this scoring process to assess your business model with the greatest accuracy.
      Remember that your competitors are actively working to improve there competitive
      position and therefore business models erode over time. No matter what your
      score, your best source of competitive advantage is to be continually actively
      working to refine and improve your business model.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1323378575149393.jpg\"

      the past, you may not have given much thought to your business model. Most business

    - ! "<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>No matter what business you are in, there are
      times when borrowing money makes good financial sense. Trying to finance growth
      internally presents challenges and restrictions to most companies especially
      when upfront investment is required, and the proper capital structure and working
      capital support are not in place.</p>\r\n<p>Even if you are not contemplating
      a loan, bankers are merely very cautious investors who only invest in strong
      companies that are well run. For this reason, the Bankability Index is actually
      a report card on the strength of [Company Name] and its ability to generate
      an attractive ROI. For this reason, it is highly instructive for you as CEO
      to know how bankable [Company Nickname] is and also things you might do to improve.</p>\r\n<p>The
      first step for [Company Nickname] to apply for a loan will be to present your
      bank with a comprehensive overview of your business by providing them with a
      business plan that gives them a full strategic understanding of you and [Company
      Nickname]. The business plan will need to address any challenges that you and
      the company are facing and a plan of how you are meeting them - now and in the
      next couple of years.</p>\r\n<p>It is useful to the bank, if not required, to
      provide a detailed explanation of the purpose of the loan. This could for example
      be an outline of how the purchase of additional equipment would enhance revenues,
      efficiencies and profitably. You should include relevant information such as
      purchasing contract details outlining delivered and installed price, capital
      expenditure justification studies and projected timelines. An integral part
      of the information will be a schedule detailing the projected cash-flow and
      draws against the desired loan for [Company Nickname].</p>\r\n<p>You will be
      required to provide a full set of financial reports, which will include at least
      the most recent balance sheet and income statements for [Company Nickname] as
      well as any notes that would provide them with a clear understanding of the
      company’s financial condition. Most banks prefer at least 2 trading year’s worth
      of financials and will not even consider any company that cannot provide this.
      A bank loan is highly unlikely if you have not been in business for more than
      2 years. This information will allow the bank to gain a proper understanding
      of recent trends within your business. Personal financial information is increasingly
      being used to supplement the company’s information. So you will likely be required
      to provide your FICO score and full personal financial reports.</p>\r\n<p>A
      perennial problem with small businesses is the fact that owners generally see
      it as an accepted benefit to run personal expenses through the business. The
      owner’s salary is an acceptable business expense as long as they are active
      in the running of the business, it is justifiable. Whatever the Taxman does
      or does not allow beyond this is largely irrelevant to an investor except to
      the extent that it might detract from the business. An investor is really only
      concerned with the actual ability of the business to generate an acceptable
      return. Strictly speaking, the strongest P&amp;L will be one that has been &amp;Normalized&amp;
      by taking out all discretionary and extra-ordinary personal income benefits
      and expenses that the owner draws or puts through the business.</p>\r\n<p>Banks
      all take different approaches to establish lending criteria, which are commonly
      called &amp;Loan Covenants&amp;. Most of the criteria that are used rely on
      analysis of the borrowing company’s recent financial statements to determine
      their financial strength and performance. If [Company Nickname] is felt to present
      an acceptable risk to the bank, the loan is made. If not, there is generally
      no explanation given. Lenders know they must take risks, but they don’t want
      those risks made known so when a loan application is declined, the applicant
      is left wondering what happened! You are no further forward and obviously could
      still use a loan to move your business forward. This all begs the question of:
      what [Company Nickname] would need to do to position the business to be an acceptable
      risk and qualify for a loan.</p>\r\n<p>Factors taken into consideration by the
      banks are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Liquidity and stability</li>\r\n\t<li>Equity</li>\r\n\t<li>Debt
      and Leverage</li>\r\n\t<li>Cash Flow and receivables</li>\r\n\t<li>Other investments</li>\r\n\t<li>Capital
      structure</li>\r\n\t<li>Distributions</li>\r\n\t<li>Various pieces of non-financial
      data</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Banking conditions have changed significantly over
      the last 10 years and banks are now subject to far more rigorous restrictions
      than previously seen. Consequently loans are far harder to get and many banks
      are simply unable or unwilling to lend at this time. Loan agreements contain
      covenants &ndash; conditions that the borrower must meet in order to get a loan
      and stay financed. Lending criteria have shifted as a consequence of changes
      in the borrowing patterns and covenants are not only different but far more
      stringent than in years past.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, reduced personal equity
      on the part of small business owners is endemic, which makes the need for borrowing
      more critical than ever, but makes loans far more difficult to get. Banks increasingly
      have to take account of non-financial data to gain comfort that you and [Company
      Nickname] are an acceptable risk.</p>\r\n<p>CEO Focus has constructed a program
      that utilizes proprietary algorithms to evaluate both financial and non-financial
      information to calculate the company’s Bankability Index&trade;. The program
      is continually calibrated against data drawn from businesses across the USA
      and gives powerful insight into your chances of getting a loan and what [Company
      Nickname] can do to improve their Bankability Index.</p>\r\n<h2>Lending Criteria</h2>\r\n<p>In
      general, banks that take a more restrictive approach to lending are more likely
      to set tighter covenants and be less forgiving of borrower deviations and violations.
      Banks that set covenants in conjunction with the borrower are more flexible
      on their terms. Banks are increasingly looking at the business owner’s FICO
      score and financial statements as a measure of how responsibly they conduct
      their personal financial affairs. They want the borrower to be part of setting
      the covenants, so that they will be less likely to deviate from or violate them.
      Smaller banks generally fall into this category but some larger banks operate
      this way too, which is why it is important to have a good relationship with
      your banker. Many of the larger banks have been accused of moving loan officers
      and bank managers regularly to prevent a strong relationship from being established.</p>\r\n<p>The
      aim of covenants is to protect the bank from default on the part of the borrower
      but also to provide clear and reasonable parameters and actions up front, which
      govern default conditions and remedial actions. Most loan documents contain
      at least 2 conditions of default that could be extremely serious for the borrower.
      There are 3 factors in play:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>To establish that [Company
      Nickname] has the ability to repay the loan</li>\r\n\t<li>To provide a means
      to appropriately revisit that assumption during the life of the loan</li>\r\n\t<li>To
      provide remedies if the Bank feels at any stage that the loan is insecure as
      a result of changes in [Company Name] or an adverse event affecting your financial
      condition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>[Company Nickname] needs to bear in mind that
      there are factors that may be outside of your control but that could still negatively
      impact your loan:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Change in account officer: the bank may
      at any time replace the officer administering the loan. Should there be a significant
      difference in approach, personality conflict or any misunderstanding; the new
      officer may deem the bank’s position to be insecure.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bank Policy
      Changes: mergers, acquisitions or changes in banking regulations can lead to
      changes in the loan conditions. [Company Nickname] has no assurances that the
      lending bank will continue to provide credit to them or even any company in
      their industry.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Properly set covenants provide a clear framework
      of parameters to [Company Nickname] and a schedule of review and adjustment
      (probably annually) that is designed to protect the lender from borrower meltdown
      and provide them comfort that the loan is secure. [Company Nickname] and your
      comfort comes from the knowledge that as long as you both abide by the covenants
      and work with the bank, your loan will most likely continue to be entertained
      by the bank.</p>\r\n<h2>The Anatomy of a Loan Agreement</h2>\r\n<p>In the past
      small and medium sized companies rarely had the option or opportunity to negotiate
      commercial loan agreements with the lender. The banks dictated the terms and
      standard agreements were used, thereby eliminating the need for referral to
      higher authority and cost to both the bank and the borrower of hiring counsel
      to evaluate or negotiate the terms. In most instances loans were paid off without
      ever having to refer to the fine print.</p>\r\n<p>However while still unusual,
      it is becoming more prevalent that borrowers are putting their banks standard
      loan conditions through close scrutiny to identify terms that would be detrimental
      or and undue burden to [Company Nickname]. You will generally not be allowed
      to negotiate the terms of their standard agreement, but it never hurts to ask.
      In the event that this is allowed and you find something worth fighting for
      (like an unduly onerous penalty interest rate), there is a down side that you
      need to be aware of. The bank would need to retain counsel to cover their position
      and to negotiate any changes to the standard loan terms and conditions. In general
      these costs would be passed directly on to [Company Nickname], and they will
      not come cheap! So while due diligence is vital, it is important to keep any
      negotiations to a minimum while ensuring that [Company Name] has the best deal
      possible.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of whether the bank or [Company Nickname] retains
      counsel or not, you should make sure that the following aspects are well taken
      care of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t3.1 Scope. Most loan agreements contains
      the following sections:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.1.1 Statement of the loan
      terms,</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.1.2 Warranties and representations about [Company
      Name], its properties and its operations,</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.1.3 Covenants
      which may be affirmative (things [Company Nickname] is required to comply with),
      negative (things you may not do) and financial (financial performance criteria
      which will be monitored by the bank to determine continued financial wellbeing),
      and</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.1.4 Events of default.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t3.2
      Loan Terms. The loan terms that should be reviewed are:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.2.1
      Stated Rate of Interest. Is this reasonable in terms of the financial condition
      and strength of [Company Nickname]?</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.2.2 Default Rate of
      Interest. Is the default rate reasonable? (2% over the stated rate is the norm)?
      Under what conditions is the default rate levied? Payment default or any default?
      Will [Company Name] be notified or will it automatically become activated while
      the default persists? And is it in addition to, or in lieu of, late payment
      charges (which may be subject to specific conditions and limitations depending
      of applicable State Laws).</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.2.3 Due Dates of Payments. Is
      the interest on the loan pre-computed? If not, will [Company Nickname] get an
      interest statement from the lender in time to make the monthly payment of interest?</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.2.4
      Prepayments. Do the loan documents permit prepayments without penalty?</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>3.2.5
      Attorney's Fees. [Company Name] will generally be required to pay the bank's
      collection costs, including its attorneys' fees and expenses. Many lenders standard
      terms levy fees based on a percentage of the outstanding loan amount. This can
      often far exceed the reasonable cost based on hourly rates.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>3.3
      Warranties and Representations. These are conditions binding [Company Nickname].
      Most relate to the legal status of [Company Name] and its ability to enter into
      the loan transaction. Others relate to enforceability of the loan conditions
      to [Company Nickname]. All of these should be reviewed to determine if they
      are relevant to the bank's underwriting of the loan. Violation of warranty or
      representation conditions are generally grounds for the lender to invoke default
      remedies under the loan conditions, which include the suspension of any pending
      advances or facilities.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.4 Covenants. The type and nature of
      the required covenants will most likely depend on the size and policies of the
      bank, and the size, duration and type of loan. The covenants should be reviewed
      to make sure that [Company Nickname] current and anticipated operations are
      likely to meet the covenants. Financial and information reporting requirements
      should be reviewed with management, financial and accounting officers to make
      sure that the company is capable of reasonably producing the reports and required
      information in a timely manner. It should be ensured that any financial covenants
      or reporting are in line with your accounting practices.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.5 Defaults.
      The list of defaults warrants close scrutiny and is worth spending considerable
      time on. The list of defaults provides the bank with the conditions under which
      it may terminate its lending relationship with [Company Name] and demand immediate
      repayment of the loan. Care should be taken to understand these conditions and
      to ensure that unintentional conditions will not trigger a reaction form the
      lender without the opportunity of redress within a reasonable grace period.
      Generally these relate to missed payment deadlines and banks are more open to
      working with borrowers now than they might have previously been, but may put
      a limit on the number of late notices they will tolerate before taking action.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.6
      Maintaining a Good Relationship. Any decisions relating to considerations, consents
      or waivers of covenant defaults will depend heavily on [Company Nickname] relationship
      with the lender. That relationship is built at the time of granting the loan
      so can materially affect the loan rates. Since this relationship continues over
      the life of the loan through the review process, a good relationship between
      you and your banker is critical since your banker is your most powerful and
      worthwhile ally.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Covenent Categories Commonly Used by Bands</h2>\r\n<p>[Company
      Name] Balance Sheet and Income Statements will give you most of what will be
      needed to determine a complete financial picture of [Company Nickname]. Now
      often business owners run different sets of books &ndash; one for the IRS, one
      for the banker and one for the owner to know what is actually going on. The
      difficulty comes in that you cannot fool all of the people all of the time and
      the worst possible person to kid, is yourself! This is closely followed by your
      banker since if you are going to have an extended relationship with your banker
      they will probably pick up on inconsistent details and start to ask pointed
      questions about [Company Nickname], quite probably at the time that you would
      least like them to be doing so.</p>\r\n<p>Financial ratios are commonly used
      to measure businesses against common criteria. Ratios would look at specific
      aspects of [Company Nickname] in relationship to others to gain an understanding
      and measure of [Company Nickname]'s strength or weakness in specific areas.
      Ratios can be used to quickly and simply compare companies of different size
      and industries by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Tracking ratios for [Company Nickname]
      across a number of trading periods,</li>\r\n\t<li>Comparing [Company Nickname]'s
      ratios to those of other companies or industry norms</li>\r\n\t<li>Showing if
      projected scenarios and business plans are likely to be successful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These
      are some of the ratios and parameters that banks might use to measure [Company
      Nickname] performance in evaluating your loan application as well as to track
      it after the loan has been granted.</p>\r\n<p>Each lender will have their own
      preferences but many parameters are less impactful on the overall score and
      only really come into play in marginal cases or when the finer details of a
      loan are being discussed with your banker. However it is useful to know the
      commonly used characteristics and their associated ratios that your bank might
      consider in evaluating your loan application. These are listed in this section.</p>\r\n<p>CEO
      Focus has worked with a range of lenders across the country to distill the essence
      of these ratios in order to provide a simpler yet adequately accurate indication
      of [Company Name]’s probability of getting the desired loan based on the information
      provided.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t4.1 Liquidity &ndash;\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>4.1.1

      working capital</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>4.1.3 Minimum cash &amp; Equivalents - minimum
      assets that can be readily converted into cash with little or no loss in value.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t4.2
      Equity &ndash; Usually covenants require a minimum level of equity in [Company
      Name]. Felt by bankers to be important in the meltdown environment &ndash; however
      hard to quantify since small business owners generally no longer have the kind
      of equity that they once did and are relying on loans to fund/carry their business.\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>4.2.1

      Name] obtained for the Bankability Index and Business Model Score. Since they
      play a significant role in the eyes of a buyer, they are considered a second
      time and included in this index.</p>\r\n<h2>How Business Value is determined</h2>\r\n<p>Business
      valuation is market driven. The valuation process is ultimately what a buyer
      will pay for a business and the price at which a seller will sell the business.
      Although this process is very similar to the valuation process used when buying
      a house, it is more closely aligned with buying commercial real estate. Think
      of earnings potential as commercial rent. The cost and ability to maintain rental
      income includes factors like location, ability to secure new tenants, the cost
      to keep the building in compliance with existing statutes, rate escalators and
      the costs associated with tenant retention. A buyer will consider these factors
      to determine the potential return on their investment. A buyer will consider
      the earnings potential of the business and their ability to increase its value.
      They look at what they have to spend in order to grow and improve the business.</p>\r\n<p>To
      continue our comparison of business value to commercial real estate value, the
      prime consideration is the ability of the business to generate cash. A buyer
      will measure the ability of the business to generate cash by using financial
      reports to determine the last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
      and amortization commonly referred to as EBITDA. The seller will need to adjust
      EBITDA by removing any discretionary expenses the owner might charge to the
      business that others may see as earnings. Typical expenses in this category
      would be life insurance, company vehicles and expense accounts. This is commonly
      referred to as &quot;Adjusted EBITDA&quot; or &quot;Normalized EBITDA&quot;
      but for our discussions here, we will simply call it EBITDA. Although EBITDA
      is not the only determinant of value, it is a significant factor in the equation
      and it has a profound impact on the buyer’s view of the business.</p>\r\n<p>Once
      EBITDA has been established, a value multiplier is determined. The multiplier
      is market driven and generally based on comparisons with known entities of similar
      size in similar markets. Multipliers can vary based upon market factors such
      as the glamor of the business, the markets/industries in which they compete,
      their ability to get financing including the interest rate, or in the case of
      a strategic buyer their internal cost of funds and rate of return requirements
      as well as synergistic earnings potential (hurdle rate). In addition, other
      factors that impact multipliers are the size of the business, whether critical
      skills are vested in the current owner and the cost of completing the sale.</p>\r\n<p>As
      mentioned above, multipliers can vary widely. For example, a typical industrial
      manufacturer or service company may be valued at a 5-times multiplier, while
      a medical company may be a 10 or 12-times multiplier because its markets are
      more robust and affected less by business cycles. The size of a business can
      also be a factor in determining the multiplier. Comparable businesses with 12
      months trailing EBITDA of $2 million may get a 4-times multiplier while one
      with over $5 million EBITDA may get an 8-times multiplier.</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><img
      src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1328541684939082.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sellability\"
      /></p>\r\n<p>Although these numbers and this approach may sound appealing at
      first, they are only a starting point for valuation. The reality of valuation
      is in the weaknesses of the business and the risk factors those weaknesses present
      to the buyer &mdash; commonly called ‘value detractors’. Risk factors can take
      a business with a relatively high multiplier to a very low valuation because
      of the buyer’s perceived risk. They can reduce value by as much as 90% or completely
      kill a deal. Deals are killed every day due to risk factors.</p>\r\n<p>It is
      important for owners to understand what buyers look for when evaluating an acquisition.
      Owners must also understand they cannot cover up weaknesses. Buyers usually
      find the problems even when the owner does not know or acknowledge them. It
      is not unusual for a seller to hide problems from a buyer only to find themselves
      in litigation after the sale and losing much of what they made in the transaction.
      Because problems can have a profound effect on value, it is important to resolve
      problems before putting the business up for sale, and finding and resolving
      problems may take several years of work.</p>\r\n<p>Generally when taking these
      value reductions, a buyer will reduce EBITDA to reflect the risk and what revenues
      they feel the business is likely to generate in the near future. For instance,
      if it will cost $25,000.00 to fix the problem, the buyer will deduct that amount
      from EBITDA. Or, if a buyer feels revenue is going to decrease by 10%, they
      will deduct 10% from revenue and adjust EBITDA for the impact of the lower revenue.
      In most cases, a 10% revenue reduction will equate to 20% or 30% EBITDA reduction.</p>\r\n<p>The
      most significant value reduction comes from the EBITDA multiplier’s impact on
      the sales price If we are looking at a 5-times multiplier and a $20,000 reduction
      in EBITDA, the problem will magnify to $100,000. This means it is well worthwhile
      to fix the problem before putting the business up for sale. The dollars and
      effort put into fixing problems ahead of time will yield the significantly improved
      sales price (EBITDA increase times the multiplier).</p>\r\n<p>A simplified look
      at valuing a business is as follows:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; text-style:
      italic;\">(Trailing 12 Month Adjusted EBITDA - Risk Factors) x Multiplier =
      Business Value</p>\r\n<p>Clearly, a business owner should understand their adjusted
      EBITDA, and before they embark on the process of putting their business up for
      sale, they should ensure that they have a realistic sense for their risk factors,
      and the multiplier a buyer could likely use to value the business. The following
      chart illustrates the effect of a trailing 12-month EBITDA minus risk factors
      of $500,000. Note the improving Business Value Index with increasing industry
      multipliers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 9px; text-align: center; text-style:
      bold;\">Business Value Index</p>\r\n<!-- trailing ebitda minus risk factors
      image -->\r\n<p>This salability index provides an evaluation of those factors
      in a business that adds to or reduces risk and increases or decreases the multiplier.
      It then creates a factor that is indicative of the current problems (risks)
      and how they would affect value in the eyes of a buyer. It also provides some
      suggestions of how to fix or improve problems and increase value.</p>"

      need to be certain that your business model is valid and functional. The best
      sales process in the world cannot overcome a flawed business model.</p>\r\n<h2>Do
      you really need a formal sales process to increase revenue?</h2>\r\n<p>Maybe
      not &mdash; even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while! The approach
      of ready, fire aim... did I hit anything sometimes works but it is not predictable,
      repeatable and while it feels good and productive, experience shows that it
      can never really be effectively sustained.</p>\r\n<p>The real question is, do
      you need a well-structured sales process to optimize sales revenue and sustain
      it over a period of time? Most certainly; to optimize your sales efforts there
      are 5 separate simultaneous goals you are trying to achieve and excel in:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Increase
      sales revenue.</li>\r\n\t<li>Increase gross margins.</li>\r\n\t<li>Decrease
      the sales cycle.</li>\r\n\t<li>Decrease the cost of sales.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sustain
      the process in a profitable way.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The best way to increase
      revenue while also increasing margins is to reduce the sales cycle and the cost
      of sales. And if you can’t sustain it then the other two don’t matter. The point
      here is that the five objectives are totally intertwined and really need to
      be addressed in totality to create a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Proven
      and Repeatable Sales Process</span> <strong>(PRSP)</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Here
      are some of the key issues you will need to address if you want to optimize

      not handling any one of the above factors optimally can negatively impact your
      sales optimization process. There are a lot of moving parts and most of the
      factors involved in modern sales transactions are highly perishable. You cannot

      + Mandatory Debt Retirement + loan/term)\r\n</div>\r\n<p>EBITDA is often used
      as a proxy for cash flow from operations. EBITDA less distributions and dividends
      equates to retained earnings so the DSC a.k.a. Debt Coverage Ratio is the ratio
      of cash available for debt servicing to interest, principal and lease payments.</p>\r\n<p>It
      is a popular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking\">benchmark</a>
      used in the measurement of your ability to produce enough cash to cover its
      debt (including lease payments). The higher this ratio is, the easier it is
      to obtain a loan. The ratio is used in commercial banking and may be expressed
      as a minimum ratio that is acceptable to a lender; it may be a [Company Nickname]
      loan condition or covenant. Breaching a DSCR covenant can, in some circumstances,
      be an act of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)\" target=\"_blank\">default</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Should
      [Company Nickname] have a DSC of over 1, then (in theory, as calculated to bank
      standards and assumptions) [Company Nickname] will be generating sufficient
      cash flow to pay its debt obligations. A DSCR below 1.0 indicates that there
      is not enough cash flow to cover loan payments. Most banks traditionally have
      sought a DSC of 1.2 or more but recent lending criteria have been shifted up
      significantly.</p>"

      style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; width: 400px;\">\r\n\tEBITDA\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This
      ratio is a measure of [Company Name]’s ability to pay off its total debt, including
      the new loan. This ratio gives the bank the approximate amount of time that
      you would need to pay off all debt, ignoring the factors of interest, taxes,
      depreciation and amortization.</p>\r\n<p>A high total Debt/EBITDA ratio suggests
      that [Company Name] may not be able to service their debt in an appropriate
      manner and can result in loan refusal, a low ratio can suggest that [Company
      Name] could take on more debt if needed.</p>\r\n<p>The leverage tolerance on
      cash flow for lenders or the sustainability levels on the leverage is a moving
      target. The ratio dropped from over 4-to-1 to current acceptable levels of less
      than 2-to-1 in the early 2000’s. Tightening on covenants in recent years have
      taken this ratio significantly higher.</p>"

      0 auto; text-align: center; width: 400px;\">\r\n\tCurrent Liabilities + Desired
      Loan\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Since this ratio utilizes balance sheet data, the current
      ratio is an indication indicates whether or not [Company Nickname] has enough
      resources to pay the new loan plus its existing debts over the next 12 months.</p>\r\n<p>Low
      values for the current ratio (values less than 1) indicate that [Company Name]
      may have difficulty meeting their new obligations. Low values, however, do not
      indicate a critical problem. If the loan is felt to improve the business sufficiently
      then [Company Nickname] has good long-term prospects, and should be able to
      borrow against those prospects to meet their proposed new obligations. Some
      types of businesses usually operate with a current ratio less than one. For
      example, if inventory turns over much more rapidly than the accounts payable
      become due, then the current ratio will be less than one (this is true for fast
      moving retail operations). This can allow a firm to operate with a low current
      ratio. In general small companies will break out into retail and non-retail.
      However the scoring scale has been constructed to be generic and the commentary
      will outline industry related factors affecting the overall index.</p>\r\n<p>A
      lender would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio,
      because a high current ratio means that if [Company Nickname] remains stable,
      they will have more assets than liabilities and are therefore likely to meet
      the liabilities which they face in the next 12 months. In the current climate
      a ratio of 2:1 is generally considered safe for most small businesses.</p>"

      width: 400px;\">\r\n\tTangible Net Worth + Subordinated debt\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The
      Balance Sheet Leverage is simply the Debt to Worth ratio, which indicates the
      extent to which [Company Name] relies on financing as opposed to the owner’s
      equity for funding.</p>\r\n<p>Traditionally banks have relied on asset based
      lending models, however economic conditions have forced them to move away from
      this and to evaluate [Company Nickname] financial strength and potential to
      repay any loans.</p>\r\n<p>The higher the ratio is, the more risk is felt to
      exist so credit will be harder to obtain. A value of less than 1 reduces the
      risk significantly and moves more towards a loan secured by [Company Nickname]
      assets.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever a company’s assets exceed its equity base, it is
      said to be leveraged. Companies that borrow in order to fund an operation and
      grow it are aiming to achieve a higher level of revenue and profit. This increases
      the return on equity (and probably the value of [Company Nickname]) generally
      without the owner having to put additional equity in, which is called leveraging.</p>"

      source of repayment, which is termed collateral. Collateral comprise those personal
      and business assets that can be sold to pay back the loan. Most lenders require
      some degree of personal collateral but increasingly business owners simply do
      not have sufficient personal collateral, so the lenders are looking at [Company
      Nickname] to make sure that sufficient collateral exists to cover the loan.</p>\r\n<p>Current
      Assets generally comprise inventory, receivables and cash. The presumption by
      the bank is that they are unlikely to realize the full value of the current
      assets so these assets are discounted for the purposes of evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>Loan
      coverage by the discounted collateral is generally required to be at least on
      the threshold at a ratio value of 1.</p>"

    - Creditworthiness
    - ! "<p>Fair Isaac Corporation is the creator of Fair Isaac Scores (FICO). Using
      a sophisticated mathematical formula, FICO scores rank potential borrowers based
      on the likelihood that they will pay back credit extended to them. The scoring
      range is approximately 300 to 850 points, with a higher score indicating better
      credit-worthiness.</p>\r\n<p>Lenders have traditionally secured loans against
      assets however the most tangible consequence of the recent meltdown and recession
      is that business owners simply do not have the personal equity that they once
      did. Lenders now have to look to other areas to measure lending risks. So what
      matters most on credit reports to lenders?</p>\r\n<p>While anything on a credit
      report is fair game for scrutiny, there are several instances that lenders will
      pay close attention to, which may be adversely affecting your score and [Company
      Name]’s chances of being granted the desired loan:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bankruptcies
      &ndash; typically, any applicant with a bankruptcy within the previous ten years
      will be eliminated from financing consideration.</li>\r\n\t<li>Length of Credit
      History &ndash; All else being equal, the longer one’s credit history, the better.
      Late payments look much better on a twenty year history than they do on a two
      year history.</li>\r\n\t<li>Credit Cards &ndash; Having balances that total
      more than 50% of available credit is typically a red flag, as it indicates an
      applicant is living beyond his or her means.</li>\r\n\t<li>Mitigating Circumstances
      &ndash; One bad year out of ten might indicate extenuating circumstances for
      that one year. Was the person laid off? Or perhaps sick? Many times, a chance
      to put a &quot;human reason&quot; behind a bad number is warranted.</li>\r\n\t<li>Recent
      History &ndash; What happened recently is far more relevant than what happened
      ten years ago.</li>\r\n</ul>"

    - Strategic Management
    - ! "<p>The guiding principles and values define the culture of an organization.
      If there is one defining characteristic of a well-run business it is a well
      communicated and understood vision for which the organization stands. In calm
      seas any ship can stay afloat. In difficult seas, your vision, systems and culture
      are the auto-pilot by which the ship navigates. It is what generates consistent
      performance in good times and bad.</p>\r\n<p>Organizations cannot succeed on
      a consistent basis unless every level within the organization has a clear sense
      of the specific success factors on which they will be evaluated, and on which
      the business relies on for success. The company typically has margin and profitability
      goals on which they will be evaluated. The executive group will likely have
      additional and/or different success factors. As you proceed down in the organization
      these success factors will differ depending on both the department and level
      of personnel involved.</p>\r\n<p>Each level within the business must make a
      contribution that justifies their existence. If there is no marginal improvement
      in performance directly attributable to that level it has no reason to exist.
      The product or service offering must support and be an integral addendum to
      the business model and the strategic plan. If the business model and plan have
      a product and/or industry focus then the sales process must support the intended
      focus and be designed to achieve the company’s goals.</p>\r\n<p>A product focus
      normally requires an emphasis on whether the product is faster, better or cheaper.
      An industry focus typically emphasizes how the product impacts a specific industry
      related problem better than the competitors. Often both are relevant. To be
      successful the business must understand what problem they are trying to solve,
      that they can in fact solve that problem and that they can do it better than
      anybody else. They must also know if the effort is the best use of their resources
      or if they would be better served by addressing a different customer problem.</p>\r\n<p>To
      create a successful, sustainable sales system it is critical to establish an
      environment in which the sales process can function effectively and efficiently,
      with or without your personal involvement. This is the foundation on which everything
      else is built. It is crucial to building a sustainable sales operation based
      on a PRSP.</p>\r\n<p>Any business that survives for any length of time will
      eventually experience downturns. To survive a downturn it is important that
      the foundation of your sales architecture be solidly grounded. This aspect of
      The PRSP is often the most tedious, the vaguest and the one many business people
      like to skip or do not revisit regularly once it is set up. Over the long haul
      no business can survive unless the company is organized to effect successful
      sales and effective processes are in place to sustain it. There are a number
      of critical issues that you need to address and among them are</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOrganizational
      Issues\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Executive Leadership</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Culture</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Building

    - Marketing Process
    - ! "<p>Michael Gerber aptly characterizes small businesses as being started in
      a fit of &quot;Entrepreneurial Enthusiasm&quot; by people with strong technical
      or functional competencies. As the business grows, the owner becomes more heavily
      loaded trying to cover all of the bases. This gets to be a significant impediment
      to growth since the business can then only move at the speed of the owner, who
      becomes the critical bottleneck and has little choice but to delegate if there
      is any aspiration to grow. The most common areas that get delegated are admin,
      accounting and sales, and probably in that order. There comes a time when the
      sales function has to undergo significant changes, which is often when the wheels
      come off.</p>\r\n<p>This point varies from company to company and from industry
      to industry. Also the fact is that the business would not have survived at all
      if the reasonable sales competencies did not exist within the organization.
      However whether it is a sudden step up or not, what we see in all companies
      is the imperative to take a formal and structured approach to sales whether
      you bring in professional sales people or not. In this process, the owner’s
      job generally changes from running the sales and marketing to running the people
      that run the sales and marketing systems. This is many times harder than it
      sounds since &quot;Big Bang&quot; step changes are quick but risky, while incremental
      change is more stable but far slower and characterized by resistance to change,
      so doing it this way can take many years to get sales management under effective
      control. Either way, a clear and well designed and documented process is the
      key to success and will make the transition smoother if done before the transition.
      It is equally relevant after the transition so whatever stage of the process
      you are at, the fundamentals will apply to you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This all sounds
      gloomy but actually this can be one of the greatest opportunity your company
      has, and one that can be addressed in a meaningful way within a short period
      of time and also one that will yield significant returns on effort for many
      years if consistently pursued with vigor and purpose.</p>\r\n<p>The American
      Indians inherently understood the need for hunting for theirs was often a struggle
      for survival. They had developed complimentary aspects with both hunters and
      gatherers, but while the gatherers were able to do a good job of collecting,
      their efforts were seasonal. In a tough environment, gathering was insufficient
      to sustain the tribe and therefore simply augmented those of the hunters. They
      knew from experience that the hunters were the only ones consistently able to
      get sufficient food for the tribe to survive.</p>\r\n<p>Tom Hopkins, one of
      the greatest sales trainers of all time, firmly maintains that sales is not
      a talent but a skill that can be learned, and one that lends itself very well
      to a structured process. Similarly, sales management is a learned skill and
      can greatly be enhanced by a structured approach and management systems. This
      portion of the sales evaluation module has been set up to test the strength
      and effectiveness of your company’s sales management.</p>\r\n<p>Sales and marketing
      are areas that often seem elusive and hard to manage, but often that is because
      there is little structure and/or accountability. Sales systems are set up by
      the owner of the company based on what they found to work and to suit their
      style and personality. Dedicated sales people will likely not share the intensity
      drive, commitment, vision, work ethics, style and values that the owner has.
      Not that this is in any way bad or negative &mdash; only that they do what they
      do because that is what they are good at and their style, personality, drive
      and work ethic takes them down a different path than the business owner.</p>\r\n<p>The
      burning question is &mdash; how good are your sales people at what they do?
      And how efficient and effective are their efforts in filling your sales pipeline
      and keeping the company driving forward?</p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons why
      sales people fail; some believe that marketing should feed them and endless
      supply of warm or hot prospects, others are plain lazy, but it mostly boils
      down to fear and poor management. Fear of rejection, fear of running out of
      prospects, fear of failure itself. There is the laundry list of classic sales
      excuses:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Too little marketing being done.</li>\r\n\t<li>Price
      points are too high.</li>\r\n\t<li>Send letters instead of cold calling.</li>\r\n\t<li>Talk
      &amp; theorize about prospects rather than actually getting out there and visiting
      them.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is always something very important to do rather than
      prospecting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Everyone has fears rejection but Winners deal
      with it and do the necessary, where losers don’t step up and get it done effectively.</p>\r\n<p>Many
      sales people hate to be managed because that then leaves them open to gun-slinging,
      which while it feels great is really pretty hit and miss, so generally not too
      effective and not necessarily too repeatable either. They may believe that “they”
      are the secret sauce or that they know it all! Proper management is the key
      since it sets expectations, holds sales people accountable for doing the right
      things and sets up a process to support those that have the will and the skills
      and gets rid of those that do not (sooner than later).</p>\r\n<p>In our experience
      the best sales people actually welcome and crave structure and systems, because
      they know that these help them not to waste more time than is absolutely necessary
      while helping to properly identify and maximize every opportunity. To them the
      thrill is not in a random hunt or a roll of the dice but in the knowledge that
      they have systems and tools that will help them to do a better sales job and
      ace the competition every time. And that is what consistently puts above average
      money in their pocket (and yours).</p>\r\n<p>In order for your team to consistently
      get out of the starting blocks, your sales manager, sales people and marketers
      need to know what is important and focus on it with laser precision and intensity.</p>\r\n<p>A
      big part of that, is knowing their &quot;Numbers&quot;. By numbers we mean things
      like:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>What is the lifetime value of a customer to the business.</li>\r\n\t<li>What
      is the marginal cost of the product offering (at what price point is it better
      to walk away).</li>\r\n\t<li>What work rate is required to generate leads.</li>\r\n\t<li>What
      work rate or how many touches will be required to take the average lead through
      the marketing and sales funnel to become a prospect.</li>\r\n\t<li>How many
      touches an average prospect will need to close the sale.</li>\r\n\t<li>Do your
      sales and marketing people know and understand their &quot;Golden&quot; or most
      productive hours, and who is making sure that they use them wisely?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do
      the sales people know their own personality type?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do your sales
      people know their customers personality type and are able to adjust their style
      accordingly?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do they use scripts and lists of objections? And
      practice using them often?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do your sales and marketing staff fully
      understand who buys your products and services &mdash; and WHY?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Refusal
      to play the numbers game is the same as having unrealistic expectations. Without
      knowing these things, there is no way they can consistently achieve sufficient
      output of the right quality of leads or to know when to walk away from a deal
      and be happy about giving it to the &quot;other Guy&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Does
      a CRM help - You Bet!</h2>\r\n<p>Poor sales people see this as big brother watching
      and micromanagement but again great sales people love it since it is a structured
      and measurable way to optimize their efforts (and their commissions). It does
      add work to the sales person’s load but the golden rule of any system is that
      information should be handled only once and this is best done at the source.
      The person entering the information into the system is best place to understand
      it and to put their context around it. Everyone else can interrogate the system,
      slice and dice, drill down for broader context or specifics while the integrity
      of the input remains intact.</p>\r\n<p>Knowing one’s golden hours helps to carve
      out appropriate blocks of time to do the CRM system maintenance and upkeep without
      unnecessarily eroding their most productive time slots.</p>\r\n<p>From a management
      perspective, CRM systems have the distinct advantage of giving you the means
      to stop herding cats and actually manage all of these slippery sales folk. Like
      anything of value, it does require some effort but the payoff will be substantial.
      It will give you insights that you never thought possible like pipeline value
      and timing, and analytics like closing and conversion ratios that will be the
      key to systematically improving sales performance.</p>\r\n<h2>Your hiring process?</h2>\r\n<p>Two
      truths plague small business owners.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Sales people are best
      at selling themselves.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is no test to measure motivation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>So
      how does one actually know all this up front and how do you pick the best candidate?</p>\r\n<p>There
      are very good and affordable tests like DiSC that will give you insight into
      personality type, values and motivators. DiSC in particular has put great effort
      into customizing and calibrating their tests specifically for sales people.
      Again this should form part of a structured process that starts with writing
      an appropriate job description that objectively outlines expectations, responsibilities
      and accountabilities, and ends with standard remuneration contracts and incentive
      programs.</p>\r\n<p>Having a good sense of the company’s core values and the
      critical competencies for that position will address the soft issues like style,
      motivation and each candidate’s congruence with the job and the company.</p>\r\n<p>Putting
      all this into a formal hiring process, will put everyone on a common footing
      with the great benefit in the follow-on effects of making it possible to manage
      your sales force better by actually being able to hold them accountable.</p>"

      revenue and margin while minimizing expenses and the time to close. The time
      you spend up front particularly in market readiness will generate the best return
      on time investment and will save you enormous money down the road.</p>\r\n<p>Market
      Segmentation is the first and possibly the most critical decision that needs
      to be made regarding the sales effort. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Being
      wrong here is not an option.</span> The more precise you can be in this area
      the more successful your sales effort will be. It is no longer acceptable to
      define your market segment simply by industry sector. There are two major areas
      of definition on which you should focus i.e. external and internal characteristics.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>External
      characteristics. These are characteristics you can distinguish without direct
      customer contact i.e. size, revenue, profitability, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>Internal
      characteristics. Specific to a target market. Buying cycle, value considerations,
      organizational issues, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There needs to be awareness
      of how to maximize revenue from your product or service. Customers will pay
      for only one thing, <strong>perceived value</strong>. You need to consider a
      number of key issues to insure optimal revenue.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Revenue
      Sources</li>\r\n\t<li>Pricing</li>\r\n\t<li>Revenue Drag</li>\r\n\t<li>Delivery
      Models</li>\r\n\t<li>Distribution Channels</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Sales messaging
      and how efficiently you communicate value is an essential element in an effective
      sales process. Some of the questions you need to ask yourself include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Do
      you provide your sales channel with the material they need?</li>\r\n\t<li>Your
      web site. Does it generate the results for which it was intended?</li>\r\n\t<li>Have
      you documented the most frequently asked questions and their responses?</li>\r\n\t<li>Does
      your sales channel have sufficient technical support?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do you have
      a sales automation tool that keeps track of sales campaigns?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can
      a proposal be easily structured in an acceptable time frame for your customer
      set?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do you have presentations to cover the various audiences
      you will encounter?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can you easily communicate how well you can
      service the customer?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are your references solid and will they
      respond to prospect inquiries?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Having knowledge and experience
      in a given industry is a positive aspect of any sales process. However, being
      able to directly address a customer’s needs in a direct manner is what will
      make a significant difference in your sales results. In addition, knowing how
      to best market it so as to make your unique value proposition jump out is what
      will set you apart from your competitors.</p>\r\n<p>Generating leads has become
      the major marketing challenge in the last 10 to 20 years. Approaches which typically
      produced satisfactory results in the past have become so pervasive so quickly
      that new and unique approaches appear in the market almost daily. This area
      is commanding more attention and often requires a &quot;try it and see&quot;
      approach. Mailers, telemarketing, traditional advertising, webinars, emails,
      internet ads, event marketing, networking, SEO, social marketing, etc. offer
      a business a plethora of choices. Selecting the ones that are going to work
      for you is a daunting task. The key is to know what your prospects read, where
      they hang out and with whom they associate. Industry groups often will provide
      you a clue to some of these answers.</p>\r\n<p>Generating leads is only part
      of the process. It is just as important to determine how many leads convert
      to actual customers, why and at what cost? With the number of lead generation
      techniques available optimization requires careful attention to the efficiency
      and effectiveness of the selected approaches. This is a science that is more
      complex than you might imagine. For example:\r\nTechnique A may generate the
      lowest cost per lead but B is a lower cost per conversion to revenue while C
      has a better return on profit. In addition, you may find that the analyses change
      over time. Therefore a rigid analysis needs to be adhered to which may require
      testing a select number of approaches to determine what works for your business.</p>\r\n<p>Although
      the focus of this assessment is the sales process it must be an extension of
      the business model. Whenever revenue, margin, sales cycle, sales expense or
      profitably turn down both must be analyzed to determine where initial effort
      must be applied. To reiterate the point we made at the outset, the best sales
      process cannot overcome a flawed business model. For example, as part of the
      sales process knowledge of the competition, their market share, and their value
      proposition is critical. However, if you haven’t considered how to prevent new
      competitors from entering your markets or how to keep your customers from leaving
      all you are doing is admiring your problem. The competition has consideration
      as both part of the sales process and the business model. Another example occurs
      when the cost of sales begins to become excessive. If the increased costs are
      the result of salary and commissions for the sales force maybe you have a product
      or service that requires super stars to sell and your real problem is that you
      need to simplify the sales process and make your offerings easier to sell, a
      business model issue. This sometimes results in continuing turnover of the sales
      force with the accompanying expenses of recruiting, hiring, and training. You
      can’t buy a sales force.</p>\r\n<p>It’s well known that it is easier and less
      expensive to sell to existing customers than to find new ones. Good customers
      will be the target of all of your competitors. The better the customer the more
      competitive pressure you can anticipate. To maintain your customer base the
      essential message you need to convey is that your value proposition is significant
      enough that changing vendors does not make business sense. There are several
      considerations on which you need to focus since value is a perceived attribute.
      Within your customer’s organization there are several individuals that will
      influence, recommend and make the business decisions. Often, they will have
      different buying values. Your job is to know who makes up the real power kluge
      and what each of them perceives as value. There is also an implication that
      depending on the value that this customer has for your business you need to
      assess how much attention he deserves.</p>\r\n<p>There is no better or positive
      message that can be made about your company than what is contained in a reference
      or referral. Making certain that every customer is referenceable should be a
      major objective of your business. That doesn’t mean that there will not be situations
      where your product or service does not meet customer satisfaction. However,
      the way you handle customer problems will to a great extent determine your reputation
      and what customers will be willing to say about you. It is highly recommended
      that you ask each customer if they would be willing to be a reference. This
      accomplishes three things. First it will tell you what your customer really
      thinks of you second, it will give you something to advertise and third, it
      gives you an excellent opportunity to ask him for a referral to another business
      that uses your offerings. Being referred by a trusted friend or advisor is absolutely
      the best and quickest way to acquire new accounts. Seeking referrals should
      be a rigid part of the sales process.</p>"

    - ! "<p>Conventional wisdoms for the last 3 decades has been to move from a basis
      of functional competencies (sell what we make) to a marketing led organization
      (make what we can sell). This marketing led approach and the advent of the internet
      has led to blurring of the lines between sales and marketing. The net result
      is a sales and marketing process that is often very confusing to the customer.</p>\r\n<p>From
      the outside looking in, it is difficult to determine where marketing ends and
      the sales process begin, which is not a problem as long as the process is functionally
      seamless, in fact many would say that this is distinct advantage. However this
      can be a big problem if there is any disconnect internally in contact, support
      and responsibilities at the transition point.</p>\r\n<p>In fact with the emergence
      of internet marketing, and CRM systems, the process is designed to be seamless
      and to steadily heard prospects through the sales funnel with a carefully considered
      series of marketing and then sales &quot;Touches&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>In a small
      business, most times the marketing and sales are directed by the owner or a
      very small team &mdash; generally on a much less formal basis. Larger businesses
      will need to have a larger sales team, demanding a dedicated sales manager.
      As a company grows, the transition can be extremely tough since it requires
      a significant change in culture, work habits and skill sets. Often the people
      that make you successful as a small business are actually a liability in a larger
      business because they are generalist’s not highly effective specialists. Sales
      and sales management skills can be learned but given the critical nature of
      sales to the organization a small company does not have the time of the luxury
      of training salespeople from scratch on a broad scale.</p>\r\n<p>Marketing attracts
      the right kind of leads, and sales takes over to qualify them and keep them
      moving through the process till they can be monetized. If that sounds calculating,
      that is because it absolutely is. This is what we call the Proven and repeatable
      Sales Process PRSP.</p>\r\n<p>A well designed PRSP maximizes the marketing effect
      and then ensures that the ball is not dropped between marketing and sales, and
      then successfully walks sufficient numbers of prospects through the steps within
      the sales process. It is something that should be as solidly set up as possible
      and then continually dialed in till it is a finely tuned money making machine.</p>\r\n<p>Internally
      a circular argument does need to be settled. Cash is king so sales trumps marketing
      but without decent leads, sales suffer. The synergy between these two critical
      parts of the business has to be present for a company to grow and these days
      if you are not growing, you are going backwards.</p>\r\n<p>There is an old quality
      control mantra &mdash; &quot;You get what you measure&quot;. This holds true
      for any system and the best way to take the conflict out of the situation is
      to ensure that the team shares common values and is focused on common goals.
      Your team should know with certainty what the company's mission, objectives,
      strategies, tactics are. CRM systems can be a great help here since only once
      each team member can be measured and held accountable for their contribution
      in the context of the overall effect, will they integrate and work together
      to grow achieve the company’s growth targets.</p>"

      challenge is to create dramatically improve your margins. There is no such thing
      as a great company that does not have great margins. The two go together. You
      need to begin to innovate and refine your business model to grow your margins.
      You may have bad competitors crowding the marketplace and eroding your margin.
      Can you differentiate your product to command higher margins? What additional
      value or features can you add to the offering to allow you to charge more? Are
      there dramatic cost saving opportunities? Remember, no margin, no mission.</p>\r\n<p>You
      may need to start fresh. You will continue to struggle if you do not raise margins.
      It may be difficult or impossible to modify your existing offerings to dramatically
      raise margins. If this is the case, you may be better off to add a new offering
      rather than modify a flawed one. Many great companies were born as small trial
      divisions of failed companies. Toys'R'Us us was a small division of a failed
      retailer. CarMax was a division of Circuit City. Consider introducing a high-margin
      product or service that could turn into a significant portion of your revenue.</p>\r\n<p><img

      models erode, as will yours. It will not be in minutes, weeks or months. It
      will be over the course of years or decades. However, all business models do

      alt=\"Business Model Survey\" title=\"Business Model Survey\" /></p>\r\n<p>In
      order to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers. If
      you have too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot pay
      you, or if your customers are so difficult they strain the organization, you
      do not have quality customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will force
      you to devote precious organizational resources to activities that do not grow
      your business. Fortunately, you do not have many of these issues. Your focus
      can move toward adding even higher quality customers and retaining the ones
      you have.</p>\r\n<h2>The key considerations on quality customers:</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Are
      our customers overly price conscious? If customers have their eye on nothing
      but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses to remain profitable. Ideally,
      what needs to be done is to find the customers who are going to attribute value
      to something, other than sales price. If that cannot be accomplished, you are
      selling a product which the customer perceives as somewhat generic. You need
      to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding can allow you to attack a different
      segment of the marketplace, and charge a premium for some attribute other than
      the generic product. This attribute does not need to be significant. Many brands
      have only subtle differences. For example, all the variations of toothpaste
      are basically the same. You squeeze a tube and a paste comes out. However, dozens
      of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>In every
      business relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate
      terms.&quot; Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate
      many of the business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics
      in the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies,
      these seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance, many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web to
      &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this is
      a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>A
      small vendor dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms
      in the same way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard
      some business stories about vendors that have specifically chosen not do business
      with companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers because all the terms are dictated
      by the goliath.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>A quality customer isn’t always a large customer.
      A quality customer is one that consistently provides many dollars of margin
      to your business. Sometimes they are large customers, sometimes they are not.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>The
      third consideration of quality customers is having a low cost to attract them
      compared to their lifetime value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue
      or margin. Imagine you are in a business with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say
      that the cost of acquiring a new customer is $25,000. If your average customer
      stays only 6 months, and you sell, on average, $100,000 of product at a 50 %
      margin during that time, you will spend half the lifetime value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring the
      customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>There are several
      questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><img
      src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895691906.jpg\" class=\"right\" alt=\"\"
      title=\"\" />What is difficult about attracting customers? Attracting customers
      is difficult for every business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening
      a Cheesecake Factory here.&quot; I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory
      opened in my hometown, the lines were incredibly long, even during non-peak
      times. They had two-hour waits at 2pm on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory. He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story is, even the businesses that
      are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have worked hard to get them.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Do
      you know the easy places to find customers? Are you paying expensive sales people
      to sell the product rather than using inexpensive marketing? Are you over-marketing
      when the product simply needs to be sold? Do you need a branding makeover because
      your brand lacks meaning to the customer? Are you compensating for your weak
      brand through other methodologies, such as lowering your price or putting extra
      emphasis on the sales function?</p>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>How
      long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job for
      their customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t enough
      to just do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you can employ
      that will allow you to retain your customers longer than you would by just doing
      a good job. This does not mean over-managing retention will cover up lousy work.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Create
      a spreadsheet of your top five customers. How long does an average customer
      stay with your business? It may take several years. Imagine you keep a customer
      4 years. What is the lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years
      retention vs. 4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You
      need 25% less sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace
      the customer for an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies
      having a great customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds
      of thousands of dollars to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be pragmatic.
      By retaining them for 10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact on your
      business will be astronomical. The hardest customer to acquire is the new one.
      By reducing the sales effort by 25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire customer
      with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Points
      to Consider </h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>What are the industry benchmarks for customer
      acquisition? How do you compare?</li>\r\n\t<li>What does it cost your competitors
      to acquire a customer? Is it higher or lower than yours?</li>\r\n\t<li>What’s
      your competitor’s average retention? Do you retain your customers longer than
      your competitors? Why?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are your customers more price sensitive
      than those of your competitors? If you have excessively price-conscious customers,
      do you have the opportunity to switch these customers for better ones? Who are
      those better customers? Do you have the opportunity to adjust the verticals
      you operate in to attract less price-conscious customers? Do you have any customers
      on the books that were purposely forfeited by your competitors? If so why?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Action
      Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Run a customer profitability analysis as shown in the attached
      spreadsheet:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1325876401721778.png\"
      alt=\"Customer Profitability Analysis\" title=\"Customer Profitability Analysis\"
      /></p>\r\n<p>Rank your customers by sales in descending order putting the best
      customer first and the worst customer last in order of sales. Include several
      other criteria, including subjective definitions like how difficult they are
      to deal with, how do they tax the organization, what’s their sales growth, and
      what additional demands they have. Do they demand excessive discounts even though
      they pay net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated with carrying their
      accounts receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time or C.O.D.?</p>\r\n<p>What
      you will find after running this customer cost analysis is the customer rankings
      will change. Many people find out that the customer they thought was their fourth
      best is actually their best customer and the one they thought was their best
      is actually their seventh best. This may lead you to some difficult decisions,
      in particular, the need to fire customers. You may find that some customers
      tax the organization to such an extent that you will make more money by not
      selling to them. This is always a difficult realization because most business
      owners are programmed to think that there is no such thing as a bad customer,
      and that anyone who gives you money is a good customer. This is usually true.
      But occasionally, it can be false. I encourage you to do a customer analysis
      annually to see what the true margin provided by each customer.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>In the Business Model Secrets program, we determine the
      extent of your customers’ price consciousness. When a customer is &quot;price
      sensitive&quot; it’s almost never about price, it’s about value. Picture a scale.
      If the customer is only going to pay a certain amount, what they are saying
      is, &quot;Based upon the value of features and benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot;
      Rather than just lowering price, let’s add value instead. This can be a great
      way to increase the price slightly while providing better value to the customer.
      This extra value may be in the form of a new or modified product. For instance,
      make a premium version of your product. Figure out how to add features, benefits,
      and attributes and see if that product will command a higher price.</p>\r\n<p>Premium
      ice cream is a great example. Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream in
      half gallon tubs was the bulk of the ice cream market twenty years ago. Then,
      premium brands like Haagen Daz entered as a tiny segment of the market. These
      were more expensive, higher-margin products. Before long, premium ice cream
      became a very large segment of the total ice cream market. You never know what
      is going to happen with a segment or brand. It could explode. Who would have
      figured that Starbucks would have nearly 50% of the coffee market when you can
      get a similar cup of coffee down the street at McDonalds for a buck?</p>"

      primary determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary
      skill can sell a reasonable amount of the product or service. The salesperson
      should not have to sell ice to Eskimos.  Many times business owners think, &quot;If

      problem and the quality of the sales staff is almost never the sales issue.
      Typically, the issue is the salability of the product combined with potential

      can focus your attention on building a strong sales and marketing process to

      /></p>\r\n<p>You can do a better job ignoring your own opinions and biases regarding
      &quot;what the customer wants, needs and desires.&quot; Instead, listen to the
      market. You should pay attention to market data, not your own subjective opinions.
      Listening to the market instead of listening to you is a great tactic to use
      to create an easy-to-sell product.</p>\r\n<p>Every product needs to be sold.
      However, some products need more selling and others need more marketing in order
      to &quot;tee-up&quot; the sale. For instance, insurance tends to be sold more
      than marketed. Toothpaste tends to be marketed more than sold.</p>\r\n<p>The
      easiest way to determine whether your product needs to be sold or marketed is
      to do an exercise I call &quot;all or nothing.&quot; Here is an example: if
      you could only sell your product and were allowed NO marketing, what would happen?
      This means no brochures, no ads, no commercials, nothing resembling marketing
      at all. It all goes away. You only have your sales force. However, you have
      the best sales force in the world. It’s a team of nothing but superstars. What
      happens to your sales? Do they go up? Do they go down? Dramatically or slightly?</p>\r\n<p>Now
      flip over the coin. You can do no selling whatsoever, not even bad-sales-people
      selling. However, the best marketing team in the world works with your product.
      You get all those promotional items that you currently don’t have: marketing
      geniuses, Web 2.0 strategies, every terrific marketing technique you can think
      of is implemented. What happens? Do sales go to zero? Do sales skyrocket?</p>\r\n<p>In
      truth, marketing brings prospects to your door. When marketing brings people
      to you they are sometimes fully sold, and sometimes only partially sold. For
      most businesses, marketing partially sells prospects and the sales force needs
      to do the rest. Answering this question can be very challenging. However, it
      will let you know which is more important for your product or service, marketing
      or sales.</p>\r\n<p>Many times I see business owners who put too much emphasis
      on selling, when the prerequisite to the sale is really the marketing. In this
      case, marketing needs to be effective in order to make the product more saleable.</p>\r\n<p>The
      second component of easy to sell is filling an unserved or underserved market.
      It’s as simple as comparing the demand for the product or service to how many
      vendors are chasing market share. A product is easier to sell in an unserved
      or underserved market. In a crowded market yours ends up being a &quot;me too&quot;
      product, even if it is outstanding.</p>\r\n<p>Ask yourself: How would your customers
      feel if your company disappeared tomorrow? If your customers would experience
      a problem filling the need you serve, great! If your answer is closer to, &quot;I
      don’t think they would have a hard time finding another HVAC contractor in Chicago,&quot;
      then let’s get to work and strengthen your value proposition.</p>\r\n<p>Every
      product or service should have a definable and repeatable sales process. Many
      times we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem to
      do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve. Great sales people
      who move from company to company and continue to sell well do so because they
      are great at understanding how to sell products. This does not mean they excel
      at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great sales people is they are
      great at creating a sales process.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the truly great sales people
      do it naturally, without knowing how they do it. They create a procedure, a
      series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless, which result
      in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every company, if
      you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create a definable
      and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this, you probably have
      a definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\r\n<p>A subcomponent of a definable
      and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal prospect be identified and defined?
      If you don’t know where to find the people who buy your products, you will not
      have an easy time selling them. Can you simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages,
      or are you trying to search for a needle in a haystack?  Since you scored well
      on this, you probably know the profile of your ideal prospect.</p>\r\n<p><img

      and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;
      product are in front of the parade, not behind it. Most products and services
      only have a 20-year life span. You want to be out in front of the growth curve,
      not chasing it. Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market which
      is maturing. When this happens, prices drop, competition increases, and the
      market declines. These are the markets you not only want to avoid getting into,
      but want to get out of. You always need to be aware of where you are in the
      product development and product life cycles.</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are
      you thinking like a customer?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are you analyzing true, unfiltered
      data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting data to be what you want
      or need it to be?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are you blaming your sales people for marketing

      parade, how can you alter the customers you sell to, and the product or service
      mix you offer, so you can get in front of the parade?</li>\r\n\t<li>Is your
      parade coming to an end in the foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade
      to replace this one?</li>\r\n\t<li>Have you looked at your existing prospect
      list and performed an in-depth analysis to determine how you find, generate
      interest from, and sell prospects? Have you gone through your prospect list
      to see if you can create a process for finding more of them?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Action
      Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Look into your crystal ball three, four, or five years into
      the future. Don’t look at what the future of your company holds, but at the
      future of your industry, and the general environment your company will be operating
      in. What does this environment look like?</p>\r\n<p>What does the general economy
      look like?</p>\r\n<p>What does the local and state economy look like?</p>\r\n<p>What
      do the customers you sell to look like? Are their industries growing or contracting?</p>\r\n<p>What
      technology trends exist in your industry?</p>\r\n<p>How can you take your predictions
      of the future and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front
      of the parade. We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business
      Model Secrets course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How
      did you generate them as prospects? How did you generate interest from them
      during initial conversations? How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when
      analyzing this. Don’t drink your own Kool-Aid and believe what you want to believe.

      class=\"right thumbnail\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" />Sit down with your best salespeople
      and/or your best former salespeople and pick their brains. Get insight into
      the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to tell you, &quot;I don’t know
      how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot; This is not true. They used
      a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last five big sales they had,
      step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and search for the commonalities.
      There will be plenty of them. Now take that information and create a company-wide,
      repeatable sales process so you can elevate the performance of your average,
      and not so average, performers.</p>\r\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved or underserved
      markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace and get ahead of
      the competition. If you can, create new products and services that will be easy
      to sell and have high margins.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>Savvy
      business owners learn from the masters. They know how to take a 100-year-old
      idea and modify it for today’s market. There are two powerful ideas you can
      borrow from Thomas Edison and King Gillette to create a product that is easier
      to sell.</p>\r\n<p>Thomas Edison had to install electric lights for free in
      a New York high rise because he couldn’t get anyone to try them. Similarly,
      Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his safety razors. It’s hard to imagine
      such superior products were not accepted by the marketplace, but it happens
      all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat consumer apathy, he created a massive
      network of partners to give away his razors (the whole unit with handle and
      blades) for free. Once consumers used the product, they saw the value and came
      back for the high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\r\n<p>Other
      companies like Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford
      was quoted as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement
      parts.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Remember, a powerful business model can create an easier
      to sell product and reduce reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>"

      primary determinant of &quot;Easy to Sell&quot; is if a sales person of ordinary

      times we see an outstanding salesperson come into an organization and perform
      their &quot;black magic.&quot; No one knows how they sell, they just seem to
      do it. Perhaps we give them more credit than they deserve. Great sales people
      who move from company to company and continue to sell well do so because they
      are great at understanding how to sell products. This does not mean they excel
      at feature/benefit presentations. The secret of great sales people is they are
      great at creating a sales process.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the truly great sales people
      do it naturally, without knowing how they do it. They create a procedure, a
      series of steps, perhaps not rigid ones, but steps nonetheless, which result
      in a definable and repeatable sales process. The goal for every company, if
      you want a product that is easy to sell, is to be able to create a definable
      and repeatable sales process. Since you scored well on this, you probably have
      a definable and repeatable sales process.</p>\r\n<p>A subcomponent of a definable
      and repeatable sales process is, can an ideal prospect be identified and defined?
      If you don’t know where to find the people who buy your products, you will not
      have an easy time selling them. Can you simply put an ad in the Yellow Pages,
      or are you trying to search for a needle in a haystack?  Since you scored well
      on this, you probably know the profile of your ideal prospect.</p>\r\n<p><img

      title=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>There is an old saying in business, &quot;Find a parade
      and get in front of it.&quot; Businesses that have an &quot;easy-to-sell&quot;
      product are in front of the parade, not behind it. Most products and services
      only have a 20-year life span. You want to be out in front of the growth curve,
      not chasing it. Nothing is worse than being a late entry into a market which
      is maturing. When this happens, prices drop, competition increases, and the
      market declines. These are the markets you not only want to avoid getting into,
      but want to get out of. You always need to be aware of where you are in the
      product development and product life cycles.</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are
      you thinking like a customer?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are you analyzing true, unfiltered
      data that is coming to you, or are you interpreting data to be what you want
      or need it to be?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are you blaming your sales people for marketing
      problems?</li>\r\n\t<li>How solid is your definable and repeatable sales process?</li>\r\n\t<li>Will
      you continue to be in front of the parade or behind it?</li>\r\n\t<li>If you
      are in danger of getting behind the parade, how can you alter the customers
      which you sell to, and the product or service mix you offer, so you can get
      in front of the parade?</li>\r\n\t<li>Is your parade coming to an end in the
      foreseeable future? How can you find a new parade to replace this one?</li>\r\n\t<li>Have
      you looked at your existing prospect list and performed an in-depth analysis
      to determine how you find, generate interest from, and sell prospects? Have
      you gone through your prospect list to see if you can create a process for finding
      more of them?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Look into your crystal
      ball three, four, or five years into the future. Don’t look at what the future
      of your company holds, but at the future of your industry, and the general environment
      your company will be operating in. What does this environment look like?</p>\r\n<p>What
      does the general economy look like?</p>\r\n<p>What does the local and state
      economy look like?</p>\r\n<p>What do the customers you sell to look like? Are
      their industries growing or contracting?</p>\r\n<p>What technology trends exist
      in your industry?</p>\r\n<p>How can you take your predictions of the future
      and capitalize on them? These predictions are how you get in front of the parade.
      We do a detailed, in-depth analysis like this in the Business Model Secrets
      course. Take a look at your best ten or twenty customers. How did you generate
      them as prospects? How did you generate interest from them during initial conversations?
      How did you sell them? Be very pragmatic when analyzing this. Don’t drink your
      own Kool-Aid and believe what you want to believe. Think exclusively from the
      customer’s point of view.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1324486881300460.jpg\"
      class=\"right thumbnail\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" />Sit down with your best salespeople
      and/or your best former salespeople and pick their brains. Get insight into
      the processes they used. They’ll be inclined to tell you, &quot;I don’t know
      how I did it, I just went in and sold stuff.&quot; This is not true. They used
      a process. Ask them to describe, in detail, the last five big sales they had,
      step by step, play by play, inch by inch, and search for the commonalities.
      There will be plenty of them. Now take that information and create a company-wide,
      repeatable sales process so you can elevate the performance of your average,
      and not so average, performers.</p>\r\n<p>Brainstorm what new unserved or underserved
      markets are going to be upcoming trends in your marketplace and get ahead of
      the competition. If you can, create new products and services that will be easy
      to sell and have high margins.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>Savvy
      business owners learn from the masters. They know how to take a 100-year-old
      idea and modify it for today’s market. There are two powerful ideas you can
      borrow from Thomas Edison and King Gillette to create a product that is easier
      to sell.</p>\r\n<p>Thomas Edison had to install electric lights for free in
      a New York high rise because he couldn’t get anyone to try them. Similarly,
      Gillette couldn’t get anyone to buy his safety razors. It’s hard to imagine
      such superior products were not accepted by the marketplace, but it happens
      all the time. In Gillette’s case, to combat consumer apathy, he created a massive
      network of partners to give away his razors (the whole unit with handle and
      blades) for free. Once consumers used the product, they saw the value and came
      back for the high-profit blades. Gillette still uses this strategy today.</p>\r\n<p>Other
      companies like Jell-O and Ford have used similar models. In fact, Henry Ford
      was quoted as saying, &quot;I will give you the car if you just buy the replacement
      parts.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Remember, a powerful business model can create an easier
      to sell product and reduce reliance on an expensive sales force in the process.</p>"

      four capitals are comprised of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial
      capital, human capital and brand capital. Your score is a composite average
      of all four areas. We’ll run through them one by one.</p>\r\n<h3>Intellectual
      Capital</h3>\r\n<p>Your score indicates you need more intellectual capital.
      Every business sells intellectual property. Intellectual property isn’t just
      for doctors, patent attorneys, accountants and chip designers. Everyone is in
      the idea, or intellectual property, business. If you make widgets, is it the
      generic making of the widgets that generates the profit, probably not? More
      likely, it is your proprietary way of making the widgets, or your secret vendors,
      or the way you train your staff that accounts for the profits. These are all
      examples of intellectual property. The only true asset your business has is
      the ability to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you do them.
      The little secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing the same
      ordinary thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you make money
      is you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better care of
      your customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little things
      are what make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively
      to your bottom line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual capital you will have and the more profit you will make.</p>\r\n<p>Your
      contacts and connections are intellectual property. Look at your Rolodex and
      figure out what a contact in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these contacts are
      worth quite a bit. Unfortunately, for most of us, many of the contacts in a
      Rolodex cannot be measured in monetary terms. These folks may be great friends,
      great customers, whatever. However, they don’t necessarily add to your bottom
      line. Though these people cannot be translated directly into money, they are
      incredibly valuable to you and your business. If you lose the relationship with
      them, you can certainly attach a negative dollar value on the loss. For instance,
      what is the value of the purchasing agent at your best customer who genuinely
      likes you? What is the value of your old college roommate who calls you once
      a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot; but introduces you to some great vendors? What
      are you doing to nurture and grow those relationships? What are you doing to
      better utilize people who could be more helpful to you? There are people that
      know, like, and trust you who may not be adding value to you or your business
      simply because you have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage the
      long-term relationships you have with these people and turn them into a valuable
      business asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex
      capital needs to be created?</p>\r\n<h3>Financial capital.</h3>\r\n<p>You’ve
      heard the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This
      is true not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on opportunities
      as they appear. There is more to financial capital than just having a big pile
      of money. For instance, how does your break-even point compare to your competition?
      If you sell your product at the same price and at lower margin, you have a higher
      cost structure and a higher break-even point.  In this scenario, you would have
      a financial disadvantage. Conversely, if you have a much lower cost structure
      and/or higher margin than your competition, your break-even point would be lower
      and you would have an advantage in the area of financial capital.</p>\r\n<p>Since
      you scored below average, your margins may not be funding your growth. This
      could creating a constantly need to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However,
      there is an appropriate amount of debt for any business or business model. Check
      out <a href=\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\">bankabilityindex.com</a> to see
      if you might be over-leveraged. Use financial diligence but use debt as a weapon
      rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially strong? If not,
      what can you do with our financial capital that they cannot? For instance, a
      manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to &quot;lock up&quot;
      the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors could not afford the
      consignments. He used the inventory as a weapon to fend off competition and
      retain the customer. Can you simply purchase a weaker competitor? Make a list
      of the things we can do to improve our financial capital.</p>\r\n<h2>Human Capital</h2>\r\n<p><img
      src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\" class=\"left\" alt=\"\"
      title=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Bill Gates is quoted as saying, &quot;Without our top
      20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant company.&quot; A great business
      cannot run without great people and your business has been successful attracting
      and retaining top talent. You may have struggled competing with big businesses
      regarding this. Have you figured out a strategy to work without &quot;superstars&quot;
      yet still have a well-running business? This is a &quot;must for many small
      businesses.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that there is an asset, not list on your
      balance sheet, called human capital. This human capital consists of the worker’s
      knowledge base, their abilities, their relationship with customers, and their
      ability to execute your business plan., All these components add up to the intangible
      value of those employees to your business. The more talented and tenured an
      employee, the more valuable he or she is to your business. You have retained
      your talented staff after spending time, energy and effort to teach them the
      knowledge necessary which to be useful to our business. Talent will flow to
      its highest and best use. Continue to carve out areas where talented people’s
      best &quot;use&quot; is working for you.</p>\r\n<h3>Brand Capital</h3>\r\n<p>Many
      business-to-business enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor
      &amp; Gambles and the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether
      they want one or not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand
      is what your company &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple.
      You want your brand to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or
      &quot;delivers on time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be perceived
      as, &quot;much more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they don’t really
      care about their customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess every time we place
      an order with them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Your brand DOES mean something to your customers.
      Let’s make sure it means something positive in their eyes. You scored well on
      this aspect, so your brand is strong. How can you make it stronger? Brands typically
      mean one word or phrase to the customer, so be careful not to overextend your
      brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop
      street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump steaks. Instead, create a new brand
      or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets inexpensive Chinese-made cars under
      the Scion brand rather than adding another model under the Toyota moniker.</p>\r\n<p>Since
      you scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect your current brands and
      add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long Tail? One of the
      principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature, more and more products make
      up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a handful of products may comprise
      80% of the sales. However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot; or winning
      products make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%. Most
      small businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place
      on the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
      center;\"><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\" alt=\"Business
      Model Survey\" title=\"Business Model Survey\" /></p>\r\n<p>These days, with
      so much global competition and so many options for every customer, there is
      virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition. Excessive competition
      crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved niche on the Long Tail
      is a way to battle this. Can market research be used to find an unserved or
      underserved niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there was market data on some great
      new niche, it would be obvious to everyone. The only way to create a powerful
      niche on the long tail is to guess a bit. Not a stab-in-the-dark guess, but
      pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey guess. You may be blindfolded, but you are pointed
      in the right direction. Listen for tiny clues from your customers, vendors,
      employees, and constituents. Most needs are latent; they won’t jump up and bite
      you. No one ever asked for an ATM, or a $3 cup of coffee, or a personal computer,
      or the internet. Someone believed in the idea, despite any data, and created
      something special. You can do the same.</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have
      you been managing and growing the Four Capitals?</li>\r\n\t<li>How is your Rolodex
      under-leveraged? How can you nurture and grow key relationships?</li>\r\n\t<li>What
      is your true intellectual property? How can you protect it? How can you grow
      it?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\r\n<p>All outstanding intellectual
      property is under leveraged. Think pragmatically and objectively. Ask yourself,
      &quot;What knowledge do I have at my company that is TRULY valuable?&quot; This
      is your most valuable intellectual property and your most powerful asset.</p>\r\n<p>Write
      down 3 actions you can take to better protect it.</p>\r\n<p>Write down 3 action
      steps you can take to augment this intellectual property.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>Here’s a great example of fully leveraging intellectual
      property. In the late 1960s, California Cedar Company needed a way to discard
      shavings from its pencil factory. Through R&amp;D, they discovered a process
      to make, what is now, the $250 million annual revenue Duraflame log. However,
      they did not stop at the invention of this product. The true intellectual property
      was not how to make the first artificial log; it was using waste to make it.
      In the 1970s, sawmills had to pay to haul off their sawdust. California Cedar
      went to virtually every sawmill on the Pacific coast and significantly undercut
      their sawdust hauling contract in exchange for a long-term commitment. California
      Cedar created a business model where they were paid to accept their primary
      raw material. Now that is leveraging intellectual property!</p>\r\n<p>Most companies
      grossly under estimate their intellectual capital.During this course, we will
      work hard to help you discover, and profit from, your untapped intellectual
      capital.</p>"

      your brand to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers
      on time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much
      more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they don’t really care about their
      customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess every time we place an order with
      them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Your brand DOES mean something to your customers. Let’s
      make sure it means something positive in their eyes. You scored well on this
      aspect, so your brand is strong. How can you make it stronger? Brands typically
      mean one word or phrase to the customer, so be careful not to overextend your
      brand. Real-life bad ideas include: Burger King underwear, Kellogg’s hip-hop
      street wear, Hooter energy drink, and Trump steaks. Instead, create a new brand
      or sub-brand. For instance, Toyota markets inexpensive Chinese-made cars under
      the Scion brand rather than adding another model under the Toyota moniker.</p>\r\n<p>Since
      you scored well on this aspect, your job is to protect your current brands and
      add powerful new ones. Perhaps you’ve heard about the Long Tail? One of the
      principles of the Long Tail is as markets mature, more and more products make
      up 100% of the sales. When markets are new, a handful of products may comprise
      80% of the sales. However, as the market matures, the &quot;head&quot; or winning
      products make up only 20% of the sales and the Long Tail comprises 80%. Most
      small businesses can’t compete on the Head. Therefore, we should pick a place
      on the Long Tail that we can &quot;own.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074472128333.png\"

      days, with so much global competition and so many options for every customer,
      there is virtually no industry that does not have excessive competition. Excessive
      competition crushes margins. Branding to an unserved or underserved niche on
      the Long Tail is a way to battle this. Can market research be used to find an
      unserved or underserved niche? I say, &quot;No.&quot; If there was market data
      on some great new niche, it would be obvious to everyone. The only way to create
      a powerful niche on the long tail is to guess a bit. Not a stab-in-the-dark

      are pointed in the right direction. Listen for tiny clues from your customers,
      vendors, employees, and constituents. Most needs are latent; they won’t jump
      up and bite you. No one ever asked for an ATM, or a $3 cup of coffee, or a personal
      computer, or the internet. Someone believed in the idea, despite any data, and
      created something special. You can do the same.</p>\r\n<h4>Points to Consider</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have

    - ! "<p class=\"section-status\">Congratulations, you scored well on this aspect.</p>\r\n<p>The
      four capitals are comprised of these key areas: intellectual capital, financial
      capital, human capital and brand capital. Your score is a composite average
      of all four areas. We’ll run through them one by one.</p>\r\n<h3>Intellectual
      Capital.</h3>\r\n<p>Your high score indicates you have some valuable intellectual
      capital. Every business sells intellectual property. Intellectual property isn’t
      just for doctors, patent attorneys, accountants and chip designers. Everyone
      is in the idea, or intellectual property, business. If you make widgets, is
      it the generic making of the widgets that generates the profit, probably not?
      More likely, it is your proprietary way of making the widgets, or your secret
      vendors, or the way you train your staff that account for the profits. These
      are all examples of intellectual property. The only true asset your business
      has is the ability to generate a profit doing the things you do the way you
      do them. The little secrets and tricks are what allow you to make profits doing
      the same ordinary thing as the same ordinary company next door. The reason you
      make money is you know a couple of little things that enable you to take better
      care of your customers, buy better, or charge a little extra. All the little
      things are what make up your intellectual property and what contribute extensively
      to your bottom line. Therefore, the more you can grow your intellectual property,
      the more intellectual capital you will have and the more profit you will make.</p>\r\n<p>Your
      contacts and connections are intellectual property. Look at your Rolodex and
      figure out what a contact in your Rolodex is worth. Some of these contacts are
      worth quite a bit. Unfortunately, for most of us, many of the contacts in a
      Rolodex cannot be measured in monetary terms. These folks may be great friends,
      great customers, whatever. However, they don’t necessarily add to your bottom
      line. Though these people cannot be translated directly into money, they are
      incredibly valuable to you and your business. If you lose the relationship with
      them, you can certainly attach a negative dollar value on the loss. For instance,
      what is the value of the purchasing agent at your best customer who genuinely
      likes you? What is the value of your old college roommate who calls you once
      a year to say, &quot;Hi&quot; but introduces you to some great vendors? What
      are you doing to nurture and grow those relationships? What are you doing to
      better utilize people who could be more helpful to you? There are people that
      know, like, and trust you who may not be adding value to you or your business
      simply because you have not asked. Is there a way that you can leverage the
      long-term relationships you have with these people and turn them into a valuable
      business asset? How can you better leverage your Rolodex capital? What new Rolodex
      capital needs to be created?</p>\r\n<h4>Financial Capital</h4>\r\n<p>You’ve
      heard the old adage, most businesses fail due to lack of working capital. This
      is true not only at the start-up stage, but at all stages. We need to have an
      appropriate amount of financial capital in order to properly capitalize on opportunities
      as they appear. There is more to financial capital than just having a big pile
      of money. For instance, how does your break-even point compare to your competition?
      If you sell your product at the same price and at lower margin, you have a higher
      cost structure and a higher break-even point. In this scenario, you would have
      a financial disadvantage. Conversely, if you have a much lower cost structure
      and/or higher margin than your competition, your break-even point would be lower
      and you would have an advantage in the area of financial capital.</p>\r\n<p>Since
      you scored well, your margins should be funding your growth vs. constantly having
      to borrow money. Debt is not a bad thing. However, there is an appropriate amount
      of debt for any business or business model. Check out <a href=\"http://bankabilityindex.com/\">bankabilityindex.com</a>
      to see if you might be over-leveraged. Continue your financial diligence and
      use debt as a weapon rather than a liability. Are your competitors as financially
      strong? If not, what can you do with your financial capital that they cannot?
      For instance, a manufacturer gave consignment inventories to warehouses to &quot;lock
      up&quot; the business. This manufacturer knew that his competitors could not
      afford the consignments. He used the inventory as a weapon to fend off competition
      and retain the customer. Can you simply purchase a weaker competitor? Make a
      list of the things you can do that your financially weaker competitors cannot
      because of their financial status. Consider doing one or more of these things
      to create a competitive &quot;moat&quot; to protect you from your competition.</p>\r\n<h3>Human
      Capital</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1324499748700837.jpg\"
      class=\"left\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Bill Gates has said, &quot;Without
      our top 20 people, Microsoft would be an insignificant company.&quot; A great
      business cannot run without great people. You have been successful at attracting
      and retaining top talent. You have done a good job competing with big businesses
      in regard to this. Alternatively, you may have figured out a strategy that enables
      you to work without &quot;superstars,&quot; yet still have a well-run business.
      Keep in mind there is an asset not listed on your balance sheet called human
      capital. This human capital consists of workers’ knowledge base, their abilities,
      their relationships with customers, and their ability to execute your business
      plan. All these components add up to the value of these employees to your business.
      The more talented and tenured an employee, the more valuable he or she is. You
      have retained your talented staff after spending time, energy, and effort to
      teach them what is necessary to be useful to your business. Talent will flow
      to its highest and best use. Continue to carve out areas where talented people’s
      best use is working for you.</p>\r\n<h3>Brand Capital</h3>\r\n<p>Many business-to-business
      enterprises feel that &quot;branding&quot; is for the Proctor &amp; Gambles
      and the Gillettes of the world. Every business has a brand, whether they want
      one or not. A brand does not need to be overly complicated. A brand is what
      your company &quot;means&quot; to your customers. It’s that simple. You want
      your brand to mean &quot;excellent service and great value,&quot; or &quot;delivers
      on time, every time.&quot; You don’t want your brand to be perceived as, &quot;much
      more expensive than I thought,&quot; or &quot;they don’t really care about their
      customers,&quot; or &quot;they make a mess every time we place an order with
      them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Your brand DOES mean something to your customers. Let’s

    - ! "<p class=\"section-status\">You scored below average on this aspect.</p>\r\n<p>In
      order to create an outstanding business model, you must improve your competitive
      advantage. You must also be able to sustain this advantage over the long-term
      to have a stellar business model. Look at AOL, all airlines other than Southwest,
      and Webvan (a former $900MM grocery delivery company) as examples of a good
      model gone awry.</p>\r\n<p>You have some work to do creating additional competitive
      landscape. Consider the finer points below to improve your ongoing competitive
      advantage.</p>\r\n<p>An excellent model for creating ongoing competitive advantage
      contains:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3>Customer Exit Barriers<img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895808882.jpg\"
      class=\"right\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></h3>\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>The
      Hotel California.</em> Like the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you
      like, but you can never leave.&quot; Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective
      at making it contractually or emotionally difficult to leave.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Owning
      the standard.</em> Microsoft owns many standards. If you switch from Microsoft
      Office, you may be hurting yourself more than you hurt Microsoft. You would
      not be able to share a standardized format document with your colleagues, customers,
      and vendors. You may not like MS Office, but you don’t have any choice but to
      keep buying it. Many industrial companies besides Microsoft have been effective
      at creating the standard. If you can accomplish this, it is difficult or impossible
      for your customers to buy from someone else.</li>\r\n \t\t\t<li><em>Switching
      cost.</em> Once you have spent a million dollars implementing SAP software,
      you are less likely to switch to a different software company because of the
      cost and headache involved. Find ways to build switching cost into your product
      or service. Switching cost can take the form of dollar cost, emotional cost,
      organizational inertia, or risk, individually or in any combination.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Low
      value gained by switching.</em> Remember when you could switch long distance
      companies and cut your bill in half? It was a bit of a hassle to switch, but
      the savings were huge. These days, you save virtually nothing by switching long-distance
      carriers. That’s why telemarketers are no longer calling to get you to switch
      long distance companies. It simply doesn’t result in enough savings for you
      to go to the bother. Keep your pricing and value bundle close to that of your
      competition so the switching cost is minimal.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>
      Nothing says, &quot;You can't quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract negotiations
      can be difficult and sometimes a handshake deal is better. However, if you want
      to sell your business someday, get contracts. The value of the customer can
      be more accurately determined with a contract. If you are looking for industry-best
      contracts with the best vendor terms, look at alarm or uniform company contracts.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Low-cost
      provider translated to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this
      strategy to gain and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low
      prices, it is hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Integration
      into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying in
      sales, &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers who design the components they build for the automakers.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3>Competitor
      Entry Barriers</h3>\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Delivery advantages. Are you located
      down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will be tough for a competitor
      to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build small plants very close
      to new automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Controlling
      the distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product companies
      who have successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing channel
      that competitors will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor may have
      a superior product at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want to stock
      it, there goes 35% of the market.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Continuous R&amp;D needed.
      Your R&amp;D spending may serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to protect you from competitors.
      If ongoing R&D spending is needed, an under-funded competitor will not be able
      to continue spending after their initial entry into the market.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Size.
      Some businesses require scale that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include
      automotive, aircraft, ERP software development, and consumer products.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.
      All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and plumbers.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property, such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors. Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache of obtaining a patent or don’t meet
      patent criteria. This does not mean their value as intellectual property is
      not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola and Colonel Sanders’ 11
      Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually greater without patents.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Brand
      capital. Examples: Starbucks or Madonna.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Hard-to-find expertise.
      Limited availability of individuals with a high level of skill and/or technical
      abilities can be an effective entry barrier.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Massive marketing
      expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola and McDonalds spend extraordinary sums
      on marketing. It is virtually impossible to compete with McDonalds since McDonald’s
      spends 9% of its revenues on marketing. A new entry could secure market share
      by outspending McDonalds.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Your Rolodex or contacts. Your lifelong
      relationships with people that know, like, and trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Access
      to capital. Sometimes the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>First
      mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Crest
      - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty synthetic
      detergent</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery service</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>FedEx
      - 1st overnight package delivery service.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Your
      ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor entry
      barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape. If you
      are a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business to upcoming
      trends. Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well, they guess
      well. If you can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation. If
      you can see it, so can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small competitive
      advantage is gained from correctly analyzing data. True competitive advantage
      comes from correct predictions. Do this well, and you will always be ahead of
      your competition.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t<p>Watch out for typical threats
      to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded potential competitor
      poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled by a competitor,
      or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Points

      business by creating competitor entry barriers?</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>Action
      Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Write down the names of your five best customers. Assume a
      competitor is aggressively targeting those five customers. The competitor will
      do everything in their power to steal those customers from you. What will you
      do to stop this from happening? Pick the top two action items that will aid
      in retaining each customer and do them! If any of these action items are organizational
      improvements, implement them organization-wide.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>The
      single-most important strategy you can employ to consistently enjoy ongoing
      competitive advantage is to become your company’s Chief Model Officer. Most
      small companies do not give any thought to their business model, let alone assign
      someone to consistently tweak it. You will be light years ahead of your competitors
      if you are consistently working on your business model.</p>\r\n<p>Another powerful
      technique is to transform your sales model from the &quot;Buffalo Hunt&quot;
      to a recurring revenue model. The Buffalo Hunt is the model where we look long
      and hard for customers, find them, sell them, and then start all over again.
      Not only is this stressful, but it is difficult to run a business this way.

      is not enough to create a current competitive advantage. You must be able to
      sustain this advantage over the long term to have a stellar business model.
      Look at AOL, all airlines other than Southwest, and Webvan (a former $900MM
      grocery delivery company) as examples of good models gone awry.</p>\r\n<p>You
      have created a model with some insulation from the changing competitive landscape.
      Consider the finer points below to reassess your ongoing competitive advantage.</p>\r\n<p>An
      excellent model for creating ongoing competitive advantage contains:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3>Customer
      Exit Barriers<img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1324498895808882.jpg\" class=\"right\"
      alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></h3>\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>The Hotel California.</em>
      Like the song says, &quot;You can check in any time you like, but you can never
      leave.&quot; Cable TV and cell phone companies are effective at making it contractually
      or emotionally difficult to leave.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Owning the standard.</em>
      Microsoft owns many standards. If you switch from Microsoft Office, you may
      be hurting yourself more than you hurt Microsoft. You would not be able to share
      a standardized format document with your colleagues, customers, and vendors.
      You may not like MS Office, but you don’t have any choice but to keep buying
      it. Many industrial companies besides Microsoft have been effective at creating
      the standard. If you can accomplish this, it is difficult or impossible for
      your customers to buy from someone else.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Switching cost.</em>
      Once you have spent a million dollars implementing SAP software, you are less
      likely to switch to a different software company because of the cost and headache
      involved. Find ways to build switching cost into your product or service. Switching
      cost can take the form of dollar cost, emotional cost, organizational inertia,
      or risk, individually or in any combination.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Low value
      gained by switching.</em> Remember when you could switch long distance companies
      and cut your bill in half? It was a bit of a hassle to switch, but the savings
      were huge. These days, you save virtually nothing by switching long-distance
      carriers. That’s why telemarketers are no longer calling to get you to switch
      long distance companies. It simply doesn’t result in enough savings for you
      to go to the bother. Keep your pricing and value bundle close to that of your
      competition so the switching cost is minimal.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Contracts.</em>
      Nothing says, &quot;You can't quit&quot; better than a contract. Contract negotiations
      can be difficult and sometimes a handshake deal is better. However, if you want
      to sell your business someday, get contracts. The value of the customer can
      be more accurately determined with a contract. If you are looking for industry-best
      contracts with the best vendor terms, look at alarm or uniform company contracts.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Low-cost
      provider translated to selling price.</em> Wal-Mart has effectively used this
      strategy to gain and maintain customers. Once you are hooked on Wal-Mart’s low
      prices, it is hard to knowingly spend more shopping somewhere else.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><em>Integration
      into customer’s process or designing the RFP.</em> There is an old saying in
      sales, &quot;If you did not help write the RFP, you won’t win the bid.&quot;
      This saying is almost always true. Make sure your product is tightly integrated
      with the customer’s offering and you will have better staying power. Examples
      of this include: Intel and PC manufacturers, Coke and McDonalds (if McDonalds
      were a country, it would be the 5th largest consumer of Coca-Cola), and many
      tier-one automotive suppliers who design the components they build for the automakers.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3>Competitor
      Entry Barriers</h3>\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Delivery advantages. Are you located
      down the street from your biggest customer? If so, it will be tough for a competitor
      to match your delivery times. PPG is known to build small plants very close
      to new automotive assembly facilities for this reason.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Controlling
      the distribution channel. If you have all the great sales reps under contract,
      it will be difficult for a competitor to gain traction. Consumer product companies
      who have successfully navigated the big-box labyrinth have an existing channel
      that competitors will have a hard time penetrating. The new competitor may have
      a superior product at a better price, but if Wal-Mart does not want to stock
      it, there goes 35% of the market.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Continuous R&amp;D needed.
      Your R&amp;D spending may serve as a &quot;moat&quot; to protect you from competitors.
      If ongoing R&D spending is needed, an under-funded competitor will not be able
      to continue spending after their initial entry into the market.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Size.
      Some businesses require scale that is difficult to duplicate. Examples include
      automotive, aircraft, ERP software development, and consumer products.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Patent/Regulation/License.
      All the government regulations that drive you nuts may actually be your ally.
      If you have already complied with the regulations, this red tape keeps your
      competitors out.  Examples include: certified government contractors, cabbies,
      trucking, and plumbers.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Un-copiable intellectual property.
      Intellectual property, such as a business process or a well-implemented idea,
      can eliminate or limit competitors. Do not undervalue the patent-less patent.
      Many great ideas are not worth the headache of obtaining a patent or don’t meet
      patent criteria. This does not mean their value as intellectual property is
      not extremely significant. The formulas for Coca-Cola and Colonel Sanders’ 11
      Herbs and Spices are not patented. Their value is actually greater without patents.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Brand
      capital. Examples: Starbucks or Madonna.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Hard-to-find expertise.
      Limited availability of individuals with a high level of skill and/or technical
      abilities can be an effective entry barrier.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Massive marketing
      expenditures. Companies like Coca-Cola and McDonalds spend extraordinary sums
      on marketing. It is virtually impossible to compete with McDonalds since McDonald’s
      spends 9% of its revenues on marketing. A new entry could secure market share
      by outspending McDonalds.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Your Rolodex or contacts. Your lifelong
      relationships with people that know, like, and trust you cannot be easily duplicated.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Access
      to capital. Sometimes the key to success is to be better funded than the competition.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>First
      mover advantage. Being first in a market typically captures a large portion
      of the market that is not easily converted. Examples of first movers are:</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Crest
      - 1st fluoride toothpaste</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Tide - 1st heavy duty synthetic
      detergent</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Netflix - 1st DVD home delivery service</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>FedEx
      - 1st overnight package delivery service.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Your
      ability to consistently read the crystal ball. Perhaps the best competitor entry
      barrier is your ability to clearly see the upcoming industry landscape. If you
      are a gifted futurist, you have the ability to adjust your business to upcoming
      trends. Successful businesses not only see upcoming trends well, they guess
      well. If you can see a trend, it really isn’t futurism, its observation. If
      you can see it, so can everyone else, and it is too late. Only a small competitive
      advantage is gained from correctly analyzing data. True competitive advantage
      comes from correct predictions. Do this well, and you will always be ahead of
      your competition.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t<p>Watch out for typical threats
      to ongoing competitive advantage such as: a well-funded potential competitor
      poised to enter the market, a distribution channel controlled by a competitor,
      or alternative technologies which are possible or under development.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Points
      to Consider</h2>\r\n<p>How would you rate your current competitive advantage?</p>\r\n<p>Will
      you be able to sustain your competitive advantage? How?</p>\r\n<p>What is the
      single most important action you can take to improve your competitive advantage?</p>\r\n<p>What
      is the biggest threat to your competitive advantage? Can it be mitigated? How?</p>\r\n<p>How

      alt=\"Business Model Survey\" title=\"Business Model Survey\" /></p>\r\n<p>In
      order to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers. If
      you have too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot pay
      you, or if your customers are so difficult they strain the organization, you
      do not have quality customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will force
      you to devote precious organizational resources to activities that do not grow
      your business. Fortunately, you do not have many of these issues. Your focus
      can move toward adding even higher quality customers and retaining the ones
      you have.</p>\r\n<h2>The key considerations on quality customers:</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Even
      though you have quality customers, are they still price conscious? If customers
      have their eye on nothing but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to remain profitable. Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers
      who are going to attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that
      cannot be accomplished, you are selling a product which the customer perceives
      as somewhat generic. You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding
      can allow you to attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a
      premium for some attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does
      not need to be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences. For example,
      all the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You squeeze a tube
      and a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>In
      every business relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate
      terms.&quot; Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate
      many of the business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics
      in the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies,
      these seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance, many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web to
      &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.

      a minor &quot;term&quot; to the customer, so they give in and self service.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>A
      small vendor dealing with Wal-Mart or Starbucks may not be able to dictate terms
      in the same way as they can with a smaller customer. In fact, you may have heard
      some business stories about vendors that have specifically chosen not do business
      with companies like Wal-Mart or Starbucks for this very reason. In their opinion,
      these large customers are not quality customers because all the terms are dictated
      by the goliath.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>A quality customer isn’t always a large customer.

      third consideration of quality customers is having a low cost to attract them
      compared to their lifetime value, i.e., cost of acquisition vs. lifetime revenue
      or margin. Imagine you are in a business with a 2-year sales cycle. Let’s say
      that the cost of acquiring a new customer is $25,000. If your average customer
      stays only 6 months, and you sell, on average, $100,000 of product at a 50 %
      margin during that time, you will spend half the lifetime value of the customer
      finding and selling them. In this scenario, the cost of attraction vs. lifetime
      dollars of margin generated from the customer is horrible. To improve this,
      you will need to do one of two things, either lower the cost of acquiring the
      customer or increase the customer retention time.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>There are several
      questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p><img

      is difficult for every business. I used to say, &quot;Listen, we aren’t opening
      a Cheesecake Factory here.&quot; I said this because when the Cheesecake Factory
      opened in my hometown, the lines were incredibly long, even during non-peak
      times. They had two-hour waits at 2pm on a Tuesday. Then, a funny thing happened.
      I stood in that line with a guy who told me that his brother worked in business
      development for the Cheesecake Factory. He related that they sent his brother
      to a new location one year ahead of the store opening to develop trade accounts,
      talk up the opening, etc. The moral of this story is, even the businesses that
      are seemingly &quot;beating away customers&quot; have worked hard to get them.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Do
      you know the easy places to find customers? Are you paying expensive sales people
      to sell the product rather than using inexpensive marketing? Are you over-marketing
      when the product simply needs to be sold? Do you need a branding makeover because
      your brand lacks meaning to the customer? Are you compensating for your weak
      brand through other methodologies, such as lowering your price or putting extra
      emphasis on the sales function?</p>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>How
      long are you retaining a customer? Most businesses feel they do a good job for
      their customers and that’s enough to keep them buying. Wrong! It isn’t enough
      to just do good work. There are specific strategies and tactics you can employ
      that will allow you to retain your customers longer than you would by just doing
      a good job. This does not mean over-managing retention will cover up lousy work.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Create
      a spreadsheet of your top five customers. How long does an average customer
      stay with your business? Probably several years. Imagine you keep a customer
      4 years. What is the lifetime margin for 4 years? Now run the margin for 5 years
      retention vs. 4 years. You now gain one year’s margin at very little cost. You
      need 25% less sales effort because every fifth year, you don’t need to replace
      the customer for an additional year. The savings, in sales effort alone, justifies
      having a great customer retention program. You can realistically add hundreds
      of thousands of dollars to your bottom line by hanging on to customers a little
      longer. We would all like to hang onto our customers forever. But let’s be pragmatic.
      By retaining them for 10 to 20 percent longer, the financial impact on your
      business will be astronomical. The hardest customer to acquire is the new one.
      By reducing the sales effort by 25%, you replace the expensive-to-acquire customer
      with the cheap-to-retain one.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Points

      do you have the opportunity to switch these customers for better ones? Who are
      those better customers? Do you have the opportunity to adjust the verticals
      you operate in to attract less price-conscious customers? Do you have any customers
      on the books who were purposely forfeited by your competitors? If so why?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Action

      customer first and the worst customer last in order of sales. Include several

      to deal with, how do they tax the organization, what’s their sales growth, and
      what additional demands they have.</p>\r\n<p>Do they demand excessive discounts
      even though they pay net 90 days? What’s the cost of capital associated with
      carrying their accounts receivable balance versus a customer that pays on time
      or C.O.D.?</p>\r\n<p>What you will find after running this customer cost analysis
      is the customer rankings will change. Many people find out that the customer
      they thought was their fourth best is actually their best customer, and the
      one they thought was their best is actually their seventh best. This may lead
      you to some difficult decisions, in particular, the need to fire customers.
      You may find that some customers tax the organization to such an extent that
      you will make more money by not selling to them. This is always a difficult
      realization because most business owners are programmed to think that there
      is no such thing as a bad customer, and that anyone who gives you money is a
      good customer. This is usually true. But occasionally, it can be false. I encourage
      you to do a customer analysis annually to see what is the true margin provided
      by each customer.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>In the Business
      Model Secrets program, we determine the extent of your customers’ price consciousness.
      When a customer is &quot;price sensitive&quot; it’s almost never about price,
      it’s about value. Picture a scale. If the customer is only going to pay a certain
      amount, what they are saying is, &quot;Based upon the value of features and
      benefits, I’m going to pay X.&quot; Rather than just lowering price, let’s add
      value instead. This can be a great way to increase the price slightly while
      providing better value to the customer. This extra value may be in the form
      of a new or modified product. For instance, make a premium version of your product.
      Figure out how to add features, benefits, and attributes and see if that product
      will command a higher price.</p>\r\n<p>Premium ice cream is a great example.
      Regular ol’ vanilla or chocolate ice cream in half gallon tubs was the bulk
      of the ice cream market twenty years ago. Then, premium brands like Haagen Daz
      entered as a tiny segment of the market. These were more expensive, higher-margin
      products. Before long, premium ice cream became a very large segment of the
      total ice cream market. You never know what is going to happen with a segment
      or brand. It could explode. Who would have figured that Starbucks would have
      nearly 50% of the coffee market when you can get a similar cup of coffee down
      the street at McDonalds for a buck?</p>"

      order to have a successful business you must build upon quality customers. If
      you have too much churn in your customer base, if your customers cannot pay
      you, or if your customers are so difficult they strain the organization, you
      do not have quality customers. Dealing with low-quality customers will force
      you to devote precious organizational resources to activities that do not grow
      your business. Fortunately, you do not have many of these issues. Your focus
      can move toward adding even higher quality customers and retaining the ones
      you have.</p>\r\n<h2>The key considerations on quality customers:</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Even
      though you have quality customers, are they still price conscious? If customers
      have their eye on nothing but price, it’s very difficult for most businesses
      to remain profitable. Ideally, what needs to be done is to find the customers
      who are going to attribute value to something, other than sales price. If that
      cannot be accomplished, you are selling a product which the customer perceives
      as somewhat generic. You need to work on your brand to overcome this. Branding
      can allow you to attack a different segment of the marketplace, and charge a
      premium for some attribute other than the generic product. This attribute does
      not need to be significant. Many brands have only subtle differences. For example,
      all the variations of toothpaste are basically the same. You squeeze a tube
      and a paste comes out. However, dozens of successful brands exist in this market.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>In
      every business relationship, one party is in a stronger position and can &quot;dictate
      terms.&quot; Can you dictate terms? The customer has the money, so they dictate
      many of the business terms. However, you need to be able to dictate many dynamics
      in the business relationship. If not, you have a problem. For many companies,
      these seemingly insignificant terms add up to a large portion of their profits.
      For instance, many companies have used the self-service aspect of the web to
      &quot;force&quot; customers to be their own customer service rep or troubleshooter.
      They are dictating terms and dramatically lowering costs. Typically, this is

      excellent business model operates in an industry that will be around for a reasonably
      long period of time. You can create a great business model for a Pet Rock type
      of product. The Pet Rock type product is a great product for one-person company.
      You make a ton of money and then retire. However, you are trying to build a
      larger enterprise which has more staying power. Therefore you must be in an
      industry, category, or niche which is going to be around for a long time.</p>\r\n<p><img

      Model Survey\" title=\"Business Model Survey\" />I live in the Midwest where
      there are many ethanol refineries. They came into existence at a cost of hundreds
      of millions of dollars each. Then, the price of oil dropped dramatically and
      this industry became nonviable without additional government subsidies. These
      subsidies never did occur and many of these ethanol plants are being shut down
      before ever coming online. The longevity of the industry was not sustainable
      without the high price of oil.</p>\r\n<p>Your industry may not be around for
      a long time. I am not advocating changing the business you are in. Once you
      are in a certain business, you are stuck, right? That is partially true, but
      not entirely. For example, think about IBM. How do you define their business?
      If you define their business as a provider of equipment and automation for office
      workers, their business hasn’t changed much over the years. But when you remember
      that IBM started in office machines, then typewriters, then computers, and then
      service delivery, they have done an excellent job of morphing their business
      model over the years. They were constantly shifting into industries and sub-businesses
      that were growing.</p>\r\n<p>All businesses can do this if they are open to
      change. It begins with subtly changing the SIC code of the industry you are
      in. In the 1850s people traveled cross country via railroad. Railroads were
      the people movers. Then in the 1920s and 1930s the airline industry was beginning
      and the railroads saw themselves as a railroad and not a people mover. The railroads
      were flush with lots of cash but did nothing to expand into the airline industry
      because in their minds, they were a railroad. If the railroads had seen themselves
      as a people-moving business, they would have jumped into the airline business,
      or perhaps even the automotive industry.</p>\r\n<p>Since you scored below average,
      there are some concerns as to the long-term viability of your industry. Ask
      yourself, &quot;Are you really an IT services company or do you help companies
      improve their business process through the use of technology?&quot; Do you see
      yourself as a gadget seller or do you solve a broader customer issue? The issue
      never changes, just what you sell the customer. There’s a bigger picture for
      everything you do. You are always solving a problem for your customers. What
      you currently do is specifically how you solve their problem. However, these
      specifics can change over time. Your opportunities lie in expanding your products
      or services in this strong industry.</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<p>Picture
      it is ten years from now and you are looking into your crystal ball. What does
      the longevity of your business look like in ten years? What is the future environment
      like? Is it better than today, or is it worse? How about twenty years from now?
      Do you still see growth and opportunity in your business? If so, you are in
      great shape. If you have some doubts, analyze things from the worst-case perspective.
      What happens if things play out closer to the worst-case scenario rather than
      your expected or hopeful scenario? Can you mitigate or eliminate this risk?</p>\r\n<p><img

      business owners have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their
      working lives are spent in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs
      to be a significant asset for you and your family. I believe every business
      owner should be able to sell their business for a financially meaningful sum.
      \ That sum is to be defined by you. It needs to be enough so you will never
      need to work again if you do not want to. Let’s say the amount is $50 million.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you put your business up for sale today, could you sell it for that? Most business
      owners think their businesses are worth more than they actually are. Here is
      an exercise I suggest you do.</p>\r\n<p>Imagine I work for a venture capital
      firm in Chicago. I have $50 million to buy businesses. You and I work a deal
      and I’m going to buy your business right now. I’m going to pay you with a cashier’s
      check. How much can I buy the business for, $5 million, $20 million? It is now
      tomorrow and you take my check to the bank. You have a party; you celebrate.
      I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\r\n<blockquote>Hey, we were excited
      about buying your business and taking it to the next level. This was an exciting
      opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is the management team we had
      in place to take over the business fell apart. We are not going to be able to
      successfully implement the objectives we had for the business and it doesn’t
      make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t expect you rip up the check, but I
      would like you to buy the business back. How much will you buy the business
      back for? Two million dollars? Five million dollars? My guess is that you will
      buy the business back for significantly less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Bottom
      line: your business is worth what you will pay me for it, not what you want
      me to pay you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there
      between what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy
      it for?</p>\r\n<p>I travel the country talking to business owners and have heard
      some funny answers to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal
      is a deal&quot; when I ask what they will buy back their business for. Most
      times, the buyback price is 3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However,
      at least we have a starting point. We have some work to do to get your business
      to be worth the bigger number. We will get the business to be worth the bigger
      number through business model modifications. The single best way to create a
      valuable business is to have a fantastic business model which is well implemented.</p>\r\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business owners don’t have much of one. They plan
      on continuing to work hard and build their business. These are good things.
      Someday they plan on selling their business, and their hope is somebody will
      walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed working with several clients
      who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting when this happens. However,
      this does not happen for most business owners because they lack a viable exit
      strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy, but I have a
      better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074470197223.jpg\"
      class=\"right\" alt=\"Business Model Survey\" title=\"Business Model Survey\"
      />The CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO Emeritus creates
      a business that runs very well without their direct daily input. The CEO Emeritus
      works the hours that she wants to work, gets paid a terrific salary (what you
      earn right now or maybe more), does work that she wants to do, and performs
      activities only an owner can; like being the head cheerleader, the visionary,
      the strategist, the keeper of key customer relationships, and the standard bearer.
      We call the CEO Emeritus Activities &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model
      Secrets Advanced Course covers The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\r\n<p>For
      instance, the Standard Bearer is the person that maintains the level of how
      well the organization performs all work. Have you ever noticed your business
      runs better when you are in the building versus when you are not? That’s the
      Standard Bearer dynamic at work. It’s not that you are doing anything; it’s
      just running better because you are present. Your people know the standard is
      higher when you are in the building. Bearing the standard is an activity.</p>\r\n<p>All
      of The 16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that the true value of
      the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only the CEO can perform.
      The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency activities and can
      draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing tremendous
      amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming the CEO
      Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it is more financially
      viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<p>Is
      your business truly saleable for top dollar? Many small businesses sell for
      three to five times their earnings. If you are in one of these businesses it
      makes a lot more sense to create a CEO Emeritus situation. You can take your
      earnings in perpetuity rather than cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings.
      This creates a question: In order to create an exit strategy, is your business
      better situated for you to sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\r\n<p>Every
      CEO has some work to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you
      are working to maximize the value of the business for sale to an outside party,
      or working to maximize the value of the income stream for yourself, many of
      the activities overlap. However, if you create a business you can run as a CEO
      Emeritus, you will have created a far more saleable business that will command
      a much higher price-to-earnings multiple. Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside. If you sell your business, it will
      sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus. If you decide not to sell, you
      have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\r\n<p>What systems or processes
      are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO Emeritus? The
      simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from the business
      premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there. These issues
      are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have the proper people
      in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or do you have some holes
      on your team?</p>\r\n<p>The issue is never as simple as &quot;the people,&quot;
      it’s almost always a system issue instead. Systems are much easier to control
      than people, so I encourage you to start with the systems instead of the people.
      I think you will find your people will get better as a result of working on
      the systems.</p>\r\n<p>Many times we are missing a key player on our team who
      will enable us to assume the CEO Emeritus role. What role would this person
      fill? How much will you need to pay them? Is your need for control holding you
      back from assuming the CEO Emeritus role? Is your need to be involved in all
      the daily nitty gritty holding you back from building a great business that
      will allow you to become a CEO Emeritus?</p>\r\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\r\n<p>What
      does a business just like yours that will sell for $20 million look like? How
      much money does that business make? What activities does that CEO do every day,
      week, and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What are the
      differences between that business and yours? Write down five things that need
      to happen in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get
      to work on one or two of them.</p>\r\n<p>Will your business model enable you
      make your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a safe
      way to not only build a great business, but a valuable one as well. You will
      also need to have an outstanding, proprietary business model. No one is going
      to write a $20 million check for a me-too business.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1325884218532087.png\"
      class=\"left\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" />What do you need to do to tweak your business
      model so your business is worth $20 million? Focus on number one and number
      two of the &quot;A&quot; categories (excellent margins and easy to sell) of
      Business Model Secrets. If you have excellent margins and a product that’s easy
      to sell, you are well on your way to creating a powerful business model.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you are serious about selling your business in the next two or three years,
      go to a business broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money for a business
      assessment; it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what someone
      will pay for it. The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people
      pay too much for businesses, and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment
      says their business is worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend spending
      five or ten thousand dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business. However,
      it’s a good exercise to go to a business broker and talk to someone who buys
      and sells businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable your business is.
      They may have some tips to get your business more saleable and get a fair market
      assessment on the value of your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively on the techniques needed
      to become a CEO Emeritus. Once you have achieved Emeritus status, you might
      not want to sell your business. In our opinion, CEO Emeritus is the most graceful
      of exits. Our biggest challenge with clients is getting them to believe that
      it IS possible to work 10 hours a week and make more than they are making now.</p>\r\n<p>Another
      tactic which can be used for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many
      CEOs have heard horror stories about someone who bought a business and it went
      badly. Bad purchases done poorly go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program,
      we will discuss criteria for a good plug-in acquisition that could catapult
      you to the next level.</p>"

      me to pay you. So that’s the starting number. How much of a difference was there
      between what you wanted to sell it for and the number you were willing to buy
      it for?</p>\r\n<p>I travel the country talking to business owners and have heard
      some funny answers to this question. Several people have said, &quot;A deal
      is a deal&quot; when I ask what they will buy back their business for. Most
      times, the buyback price is 3 to 5 times less than the sale price. However,
      at least we have a starting point. We have some work to do to get your business
      to be worth the bigger number. We will get the business to be worth the bigger
      number through business model modifications. The single best way to create a
      valuable business is to have a fantastic business model which is well implemented.</p>\r\n<p>How
      is your exit strategy? Most business owners don’t have much of one. They plan
      on continuing to work hard and build their business. These are good things.
      Someday they plan on selling their business, and their hope is somebody will
      walk in with a big check to buy them. I have enjoyed working with several clients
      who have collected great big checks. It’s very exciting when this happens. However,
      this does not happen for most business owners because they lack a viable exit
      strategy. Certainly, selling your business is a great strategy, but I have a
      better one. It is called becoming the CEO Emeritus.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074470197223.jpg\"

      />The CEO Emeritus never needs to sell his/her business. The CEO Emeritus creates
      a business that runs very well without their direct daily input. The CEO Emeritus
      works the hours that she wants to work, gets paid a terrific salary (what you
      earn right now or maybe more), does work that she wants to do, and performs
      activities only an owner can; like being the head cheerleader, the visionary,
      the strategist, the keeper of key customer relationships, and the standard bearer.
      We call the CEO Emeritus Activities &quot;The 16 Hats.&quot; Our Business Model
      Secrets Advanced Course covers The 16 Hats Strategy in detail.</p>\r\n<p>For
      instance, the Standard Bearer is the person that maintains the level of how
      well the organization performs all work. Have you ever noticed your business
      runs better when you are in the building versus when you are not? That’s the
      Standard Bearer dynamic at work. It’s not that you are doing anything; it’s
      just running better because you are present. Your people know the standard is
      higher when you are in the building. Bearing the standard is an activity.</p>\r\n<p>All
      of The 16 Hats activities pay exceptionally well, hundreds or thousands of dollars
      per hour, and they don’t take much time. The reason is that the true value of
      the CEO is these infrequent, high-value activities which only the CEO can perform.
      The CEO Emeritus that does a few high-value, low-frequency activities and can
      draw a terrific amount of money out of the business without investing tremendous
      amounts of time. I encourage you to consider the option of becoming the CEO
      Emeritus vs. selling your business. For most business owners, it is more financially
      viable to become a CEO Emeritus than it is to sell.</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<p>Is
      your business truly saleable for top dollar? Many small businesses sell for
      three to five times their earnings. If you are in one of these businesses it
      makes a lot more sense to create a CEO Emeritus situation. You can take your
      earnings in perpetuity rather than cashing out for three years’ worth of earnings.
      This creates a question: In order to create an exit strategy, is your business
      better situated for you to sell it or for you to become the CEO Emeritus?</p>\r\n<p>Every
      CEO has some work to do to maximize the value of their business. Whether you
      are working to maximize the value of the business for sale to an outside party,
      or working to maximize the value of the income stream for yourself, many of
      the activities overlap. However, if you create a business you can run as a CEO
      Emeritus, you will have created a far more saleable business that will command
      a much higher price-to-earnings multiple. Therefore, I recommend working towards
      CEO Emeritus status. There is no downside. If you sell your business, it will
      sell for much more once you are CEO Emeritus. If you decide not to sell, you
      have all the benefits of CEO Emeritus status.</p>\r\n<p>What systems or processes
      are lacking in your business to prevent you from becoming CEO Emeritus? The
      simplest way to find out is to physically remove yourself from the business
      premises and figure out what goes wrong when you aren’t there. These issues
      are the first systems that need to be tightened up. Do you have the proper people
      in place for you to assume the role of CEO Emeritus, or do you have some holes
      on your team?</p>\r\n<p>The issue is never as simple as &quot;the people,&quot;
      it’s almost always a system issue instead. Systems are much easier to control
      than people, so I encourage you to start with the systems instead of the people.
      I think you will find your people will get better as a result of working on
      the systems.</p>\r\n<p>Many times we are missing a key player on our team who
      will enable us to assume the CEO Emeritus role. What role would this person
      fill? How much will you need to pay them? Is your need for control holding you
      back from assuming the CEO Emeritus role? Is your need to be involved in all
      the daily nitty gritty holding you back from building a great business that
      will allow you to become a CEO Emeritus?</p>\r\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\r\n<p>What
      does a business just like yours that will sell for $20 million look like? How
      much money does that business make? What activities does that CEO do every day,
      week, and month to enable that business to be worth $20 million? What are the
      differences between that business and yours? Write down five things that need
      to happen in order for you to move closer to becoming a CEO Emeritus. Now get
      to work on one or two of them.</p>\r\n<p>Will your business model enable you
      make your business’ worth to $20 million? You may be well on your way to a $20
      million check, so keep it up. Working toward becoming a CEO Emeritus is a safe
      way to not only build a great business, but a valuable one as well. You will
      also need to have an outstanding, proprietary business model. No one is going
      to write a $20 million check for a me-too business.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1325884218532087.png\"
      class=\"left\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" />What do you need to do to tweak your business
      model so your business is worth $20 million? Focus on number one and number
      two of the &quot;A&quot; categories (excellent margins and easy to sell) of
      Business Model Secrets. If you have excellent margins and a product that’s easy
      to sell, you are well on your way to creating a powerful business model.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you are serious about selling your business in the next two or three years,
      go to a business broker. I don’t recommend you pay a lot of money for a business
      assessment; it’s completely subjective. Your business is worth what someone
      will pay for it. The valuation is just a number on paper. I have seen people
      pay too much for businesses, and I have seen people get very upset when an assessment
      says their business is worth a low sum. In most cases, I don’t recommend spending
      five or ten thousand dollars to get a formal appraisal of your business. However,
      it’s a good exercise to go to a business broker and talk to someone who buys
      and sells businesses all day. Let them tell you how saleable your business is.
      They may have some tips to get your business more saleable and get a fair market
      assessment on the value of your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>In
      the Business Model Secrets program, we focus extensively on the techniques needed
      to become a CEO Emeritus. Once you have achieved Emeritus status, you might
      not want to sell your business. In our opinion, CEO Emeritus is the most graceful
      of exits. Our biggest challenge with clients is getting them to believe that
      it IS possible to work 10 hours a week and make more than they are making now.</p>\r\n<p>Another
      tactic which can be used for a graceful exit is a plug-in acquisition. Many
      CEOs have heard horror stories about someone who bought a business and it went
      badly. Bad purchases done poorly go badly. In the Business Model Secrets program,
      we will discuss criteria for a good plug-in acquisition that could catapult
      you to the next level.</p>"

      business owners have their heart and soul in their businesses. Much of their
      working lives are spent in their businesses. Therefore, your business needs
      to be a significant asset for you and your family. I believe every business
      owner should be able to sell their business for a financially meaningful sum.
      That sum is to be defined by you. It needs to be enough so you will never need
      to work again if you do not want to. Let’s say the amount is $50 million.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you put your business up for sale today, could you sell it for that? Most business
      owners think their businesses are worth more than they actually are. Here is
      an exercise I suggest you do.</p>\r\n<p>Imagine I work for a venture capital
      firm in Chicago. I have $50 million to buy businesses. You and I work a deal
      and I’m going to buy your business right now. I’m going to pay you with a cashier’s
      check. How much can I buy the business for, $5 million, $20 million? It is now
      tomorrow and you take my check to the bank. You have a party; you celebrate.
      I then come to you the next day and say,</p>\r\n<blockquote>Hey, we were excited
      about buying your business and taking it to the next level. This was an exciting
      opportunity for us. But the short and long of it is the management team we had
      in place to take over the business fell apart. We are not going to be able to
      successfully implement the objectives we had for the business and it doesn’t
      make sense for us to buy it now. I don’t expect you rip up the check, but I
      would like you to buy the business back. How much will you buy the business
      back for? Two million dollars? Five million dollars? My guess is that you will
      buy the business back for significantly less than you want to sell it for.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Bottom

      an excellent business model pitfalls are absent. Pitfalls can take many forms.
      For example, having too many eggs in one customer’s basket, the government shutting
      you down, or removal of subsidies. Alternatively, you could be in a market that
      is ripe for the entry of large competitors. Imagine you had a spell check product
      that could be used with Windows and Microsoft decided they would create their
      own spell check product. This could put you out of business instantly. The pitfall
      could be nothing more than a hot market cooling off or a trendy product that
      has a short life span. Ideally, you should stay away from trends, especially
      short-lived trends, if your model does not have a plan to deal with them. Some
      companies, like clothiers, deal with trends all the time, but they know they
      need to move from one trend to the other.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074470477270.jpg\"
      class=\"left\" alt=\"Business Model Survey\" title=\"Business Model Survey\"
      /></p>\r\n<p>Another point of concern is when the business owner doesn’t like
      to &quot;deal with the money.&quot; Some of these types of owners have abdicated
      financial control of their business. At a minimum, you should always hand sign
      your checks. This will give you some control over the money. You can delegate
      98% of the financial function, but the high-level ownership role (a.k.a. CEO
      Emeritus) should keep at least 2% of financial control.</p>\r\n<p>For instance,
      playing the role of the true CFO, maintaining the banking relationship, or maintaining
      the high-level financial relationships are CEO Emeritus roles. You should have
      a level of understanding of your key performance indicators (KPIs), your profitability,
      as well as your balance sheet in order to have a truly great business and business
      model.</p>\r\n<p>Another potential pitfall is location. You’ve heard the real
      estate adage, location, location, location. In a business to business environment,
      location isn’t necessarily a handicap. However, most businesses pull their labor
      force from within a tight radius of their physical location. If you cannot find
      qualified personnel due to your location, you could have a problem hiring and
      recruiting talented people.</p>\r\n<p>What happens if the price of gasoline
      goes to $10 a gallon resulting in a huge shipping problem? I was in a business
      where we had a very heavy product which limited us to a 500 mile shipping radius.
      Plus, it was a deposit-type product, so there were two-way freight charges.
      If gas prices went to $10 a gallon, we would have to reduce the shipping radius
      from 500 hundred miles to 250 miles and lose all the metropolitan areas outside
      of the 250 mile radius. Does your existing business plan accommodate these types
      of issues?</p>\r\n<p>The Pitfall section contains a special component called
      the &quot;Taser Test.&quot; Taser has a terrific business model. Their stun
      guns are a highly proprietary product. They invented the market for stun guns.
      It’s a very high-margin product. It’s a beloved brand. Taser has everything
      going for it - other than a lawsuit filed every month for several million dollars.
      Even if Taser wins most of these lawsuits, which they do, they still have an
      incredible legal bill. Taser has to budget for this legal bill and it eats into
      their profits substantially. It doesn’t matter if they win or lose; they are
      going to get sued regularly. Does your business have a similar issue? Are you
      going to be prone to lawsuits or unnecessary expenses simply because of the
      business model that you are operating?</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<p>Are
      there pitfalls in your business model? Your first inclination is to say, &quot;No.&quot;
      This is the fair and accurate 90% of the time. Is there a way to mitigate or
      eliminate any and all pitfalls? Let’s go back to Taser. If Taser could push
      through legislation which said Taser is a valuable asset to law enforcement,
      and therefore any Taser used in law enforcement is automatically immune from
      any lawsuit, how would that alter Taser’s business model? Substantially, right?
      Is there a similar change you can make to your model?</p>\r\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Find
      yourself a sounding-board partner to do the following exercise. It is known
      by you and your partner that it is possible to remove any pitfalls that may
      exist in your business. How does this happen? Remember, it’s KNOWN to be possible.
      No, &quot;yeah but&quot; excuses! No, &quot;I can’t because.&quot; It IS possible
      to remove or greatly mitigate all pitfalls in your business. How does this come
      about from where you are currently? What does this picture look like? Think
      long and hard, use the sounding-board partner, and be nothing but positive.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>Mitigating pitfalls can be difficult. Many CEOs say, &quot;There
      is nothing I can do about this.&quot; Here is a great example of a Business
      Model Secrets program success story. This particular client used a tremendous
      amount of extruded aluminum. As commodity prices fluctuated wildly, he was losing
      money on some bids because his quote to the customer was a fixed price but his
      raw materials cost went up or down unpredictably. As a solution to this issue,
      we convinced him to purchase a futures contract on aluminum. If prices went
      up, he would lose money on aluminum purchases, but he would make it back on
      the futures contract. If prices went down, he would lose money on the futures
      contract but get cost savings. This technique effectively removed the pitfall.</p>\r\n<p>There
      are also several quick and easy legal tricks to dramatically lower risk. One
      of them costs only $100. We discuss these methods in the Business Model Secrets

      an excellent business model pitfalls are absent. Pitfalls can take many forms.
      For example, having too many eggs in one customer’s basket, the government shutting
      you down, or removal of subsidies. Alternatively, you could be in a market that
      is ripe for the entry of large competitors. Imagine you had a spell check product
      that could be used with Windows and Microsoft decided they would create their
      own spell check product. This could put you out of business instantly. The pitfall
      could be nothing more than a hot market cooling off or a trendy product that
      has a short life span. Ideally, you should stay away from trends, especially
      short-lived trends, if your model does not have a plan to deal with them. Some
      companies, like clothiers, deal with trends all the time, but they know they
      need to move from one trend to the other.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/picture/image/1322074470477270.jpg\"

      /></p>\r\n<p>Another point of concern is when the business owner doesn’t like
      to &quot;deal with the money.&quot; Some of these types of owners have abdicated
      financial control of their business. At a minimum, you should always hand sign
      your checks. This will give you some control over the money. You can delegate
      98% of the financial function, but the high-level ownership role (a.k.a. CEO
      Emeritus) should keep at least 2% of financial control.</p>\r\n<p>For instance,
      playing the role of the true CFO, maintaining the banking relationship, or maintaining
      the high-level financial relationships are CEO Emeritus roles. You should have
      a level of understanding of your key performance indicators (KPIs), your profitability,
      as well as your balance sheet in order to have a truly great business and business
      model.</p>\r\n<p>Another potential pitfall is location. You’ve heard the real
      estate adage, location, location, location. In a business to business environment,
      location isn’t necessarily a handicap. However, most businesses pull their labor
      force from within a tight radius of their physical location. If you cannot find
      qualified personnel due to your location, you could have a problem hiring and
      recruiting talented people.</p>\r\n<p>What happens if the price of gasoline
      goes to $10 a gallon resulting in a huge shipping problem? I was in a business
      where we had a very heavy product which limited us to a 500 mile shipping radius.
      Plus, it was a deposit-type product, so there were two-way freight charges.
      If gas prices went to $10 a gallon, we would have to reduce the shipping radius
      from 500 hundred miles to 250 miles and lose all the metropolitan areas outside
      of the 250 mile radius. Does your existing business plan accommodate these types
      of issues?</p>\r\n<p>The Pitfall section contains a special component called
      the &quot;Taser Test.&quot; Taser has a terrific business model. Their stun
      guns are a highly proprietary product. They invented the market for stun guns.
      It’s a very high-margin product. It’s a beloved brand. Taser has everything
      going for it - other than a lawsuit filed every month for several million dollars.
      Even if Taser wins most of these lawsuits, which they do, they still have an
      incredible legal bill. Taser has to budget for this legal bill and it eats into
      their profits substantially. It doesn’t matter if they win or lose; they are
      going to get sued regularly. Does your business have a similar issue? Are you
      going to be prone to lawsuits or unnecessary expenses simply because of the
      business model that you are operating?</p>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider</h2>\r\n<p>Are
      there pitfalls in your business model? Your first inclination is to say, &quot;No.&quot;
      This is the fair and accurate 90% of the time. Is there a way to mitigate or
      eliminate any and all pitfalls? Let’s go back to Taser. If Taser could push
      through legislation which said Taser is a valuable asset to law enforcement,
      and therefore any Taser used in law enforcement is automatically immune from
      any lawsuit, how would that alter Taser’s business model? Substantially, right?
      Is there a similar change you can make to your model?</p>\r\n<h2>Action Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Find
      yourself a sounding-board partner to do the following exercise. It is known
      by you and your partner that it is possible to remove any pitfalls that may
      exist in your business. How does this happen? Remember, it’s KNOWN to be possible.
      No, &quot;yeah but&quot; excuses! No, &quot;I can’t because.&quot; It IS possible
      to remove or greatly mitigate all pitfalls in your business. How does this come
      about from where you are currently? What does this picture look like? Think
      long and hard, use the sounding-board partner, and be nothing but positive.</p>\r\n<h2>Advanced
      Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>Mitigating pitfalls can be difficult. Many CEOs say, &quot;There
      is nothing I can do about this.&quot; Here is a great example of a Business
      Model Secrets program success story. This particular client used a tremendous
      amount of extruded aluminum. As commodity prices fluctuated wildly, he was losing
      money on some bids because his quote to the customer was a fixed price but his
      raw materials cost went up or down unpredictably. As a solution to this issue,
      we convinced him to purchase a futures contract on aluminum. If prices went
      up, he would lose money on aluminum purchases, but he would make it back on
      the futures contract. If prices went down, he would lose money on the futures
      contract but get cost savings. This technique effectively removed the pitfall.</p>\r\n<p>There
      are also several quick and easy legal tricks to dramatically lower risk. One
      of them costs only $100. We discuss these methods in the Business Model Secrets

      all, this is what the do. If this loan is to be used for acquiring productive

      will require you to submit budgets and strategic plans to support your case.

      be valued at a reasonable market value, even if this is below what it cost you

      Name]’s Collateral Coverage score has been determined to be GOOD. Financial
      institutions look for a fallback source of repayment, which is termed collateral.
      Collateral comprise those personal and [Company Nickname] assets that can be
      readily sold to pay back the loan in the event of default. Most lenders require
      some degree of personal collateral but increasingly business owners simply do
      not have sufficient personal collateral. Either way, lenders will likely look
      at the company on its own to make sure that sufficient collateral exists within
      the business itself to cover the loan.</p>\r\n<p>Current Assets generally comprise
      inventory, receivables and cash. The presumption by the bank is that they are
      unlikely to realize the full value of the current assets, so these assets have
      been de-rated and discounted for the purposes of evaluation. Given [Company
      Name]'s good score for this ratio, the bank should be prepared to extend a loan.
      Even so, be prepared for them to try their luck and request that the owner put
      in at least some collateral.</p>\r\n<p>In order to ensure that [Company Nickname]’s

      title=\"Sellability\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Background</h2>\r\n<p>Because the main purpose
      and key to survival of any business is to generate cash, the ability for a business
      to generate cash is usually the single largest value driver for a buyer. Although
      a buyer’s real interest lies in the ability of a business to generate future
      cash flow, historical numbers serve to validate, or invalidate, the various
      assumptions used in the prediction of future cash generation.</p>\r\n<p>When
      a business changes hands, it will typically continue along on its current trend
      line until such time that the buyer can influence and improve the factors of
      sales volume, variable cost, and fixed cost. This fact is relevant more so for
      financial buyers than for strategic buyers because financial buyers have less
      ability to affect sales volume and costs in the short term, and additional debt
      service could add to their costs.</p>\r\n<p>The slope created by the combined
      historical and projected financial trend lines presents the buyer with a level
      of either greater or lesser financial risk. As they assess a possible acquisition
      candidate, a buyer uses financial risk as one of their major criteria for determining
      what they think the business is worth (the step of assigning value assumes the
      buyer first concludes the business is an acceptable acquisition candidate).
      Remember they only calculate value on 12 months trailing EBITDA, what the future
      holds is their own assessment and they will not include any positive value,
      only any negative or risk in future earnings.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company Name] Current
      Position</h2>\r\n<p>Based on your score in this section, [Company Name] falls
      into the bottom third ranking compared to where you should be in order to attract
      attention as a possible acquisition candidate. [Company Name] lacks a sound
      financial track record and does not have the basic business elements in place
      that are required in order to convince a buyer that the ability for the business
      to generate cash is just over the horizon. This is especially true for a financial
      buyer because they lack the ability to absorb poor financial performance or
      make quick improvements to turn the financial tide.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>In
      order to be considered a possible acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must
      improve the slope of financial risk. This is achieved by creating a minimum
      of a two-year history of improved cash generation based on specific improvements,
      such as new or modified offerings and/or cost reductions, that can be demonstrated
      to have directly contributed to acceptable and improving cash generation. These
      improvements, along with any additional improvements that perhaps have not yet
      been demonstrated, will then serve to project future cash generation.</p>\r\n<p>Keep
      in mind that any improvement in general economic conditions as a contributing
      factor in your improved cash generation will carry little weight in a buyer’s
      financial risk assessment for [Company Name]. We cannot stress enough that your
      improvements must come from positive changes that you make to your business.
      These include who your customers are, what you offer them, how effective you
      are at marketing and selling, the ability to extract higher prices, and the
      costs of the materials and methods used to create your offering.</p>"

      Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>Based on your score in this section, [Company
      Name] falls into the middle third ranking, making your financial performance
      only moderately attractive. [Company Name] lacks some, but not all, of the financial
      attributes that would make you highly attractive and allow you to realize a
      high multiple for your business. In other words, assuming you do attract the
      attention of a buyer, your so-so ability to demonstrate historical and future
      cash generation will definitely reduce the value that a buyer will assign. In
      addition to price, it could also have a significant impact on other elements
      of an offer such as the amount of cash paid at closing.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>In
      order to be considered a top-tier acquisition candidate, [Company Name] must
      improve the slope of its financial performance by creating a significant upward
      improvement over a 12-month period. Upward trending financials must be based
      on specific changes made to the business such as new or modified offerings,
      price improvements, cost reductions, enhanced marketing and selling, a more
      loyal and informed customer base, improved competitive advantage, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Keep
      in mind that improved general economic conditions will carry little weight in
      a buyer’s financial risk assessment for [Company Name]. Improved financial performance
      must come from changes that you make to your business &mdash; not from outside
      economic factors.</p>"

      on your score in this section, [Company Name] is in the top third ranking. Placement
      in the top third will definitely help you attract the attention of buyers. Your
      ability to maintain sales and control costs, as indicated by strong cash flow
      throughout the economic downturn, speaks well for the overall strength of your
      business. To a buyer looking at your business, this strength allows them to
      confidently project future cash generation, which minimizes their risk and allows
      them to strengthen any offer they tender.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>While
      your placement in the top third is a clear advantage for you, you would be wise
      to consider ways to further improve EBITDA and strengthen your market position.
      Doing so will improve your chances of receiving an optimized price when the
      time comes for you to sell. Efforts should be focused on further increasing
      customer value, maintaining or even improving your pricing strategies, further
      defining and refining all internal processes including the marketing and selling
      process, and finding additional methods to control and reduce your costs. Remember,
      increased EBITDA will be multiplied into the price offered and improved market
      position will enhance the multiplier</p>"

      practices</h2>\r\n<h3>Best practice #1: Overspending beats under spending.</h3>\r\n<p>Your
      website is the front door to your company. Whether you get a lot of traffic
      or not, your website helps you gain (or lose) customers. If your website is
      unprofessional or unattractive, can you visualize a prospect surfing your website
      and saying, &quot;these guys don’t look that professional.&quot; If so, the
      prospect may excuse you from the buying process before you even have a shot.</p>\r\n<p>Better
      to spend a few thousand dollars too much for your website than to lose prospects.</p>\r\n<h3>Best
      practice #2: White Sells Version 2.0</h3>\r\n<p>The old saying in advertising
      was &quot;white sells.&quot; The point was that too much copy cluttered the
      message and actually hurt selling. On the web the same is true; too much text
      hurts sales. However, on the web, substitute pictures, graphics and video for
      white.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever possible, use video or pictures instead of words.
      In our time-starved world, no one reads anymore.</p>\r\n<h3>Best practice #3:
      Free beats cheap... by a lot!</h3>\r\n<p>In his book <span style=\"text-decoration:
      underline;\">Free: The Future of Radical Price</span>, author Chris Anderson
      (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Long Tail</span>) performs
      a study on the power of free. Here’s the experiment:</p>\r\n<p>Test 1: A large
      group of people is offered a Hersey’s Kiss (fair market value $0.15) for a penny
      or a chocolate truffle (fair market value $1) for $0.15. Results: Over 70% of
      the participants choose the $0.15 underpriced truffle.</p>\r\n<p>Test 2: The
      price of each chocolate is dropped one cent. The same group is offered the Kiss
      for free and the truffle for $0.14. The results flipped: 70+ percent now chose
      the Kiss. That’s the power of free!</p>\r\n<h3>Best practice #4: $50 worth of
      free</h3>\r\n<p>Internet gurus recommend that your free item have a perceived
      value of $50. Right now you are probably saying, &quot;What?&quot; Don’t panic,
      it is perceived value, not cost, not sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of high
      value free items include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>White papers</li>\r\n\t<li>Special
      reports</li>\r\n\t<li>Video Tutorials</li>\r\n\t<li>Insider tips newsletter</li>\r\n\t<li>Conference
      admission</li>\r\n\t<li>One-on-one consultation</li>\r\n\t<li>Assessment or
      quiz (robust enough to be valued at $50)</li>\r\n\t<li>Webinar (live or replay)</li>\r\n\t<li>Useful
      template or form</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These free items are typically called &quot;squeeze
      items.&quot; The object is to offer something valuable enough to squeeze the
      email address from the prospect. It takes a $50 item to get most people’s email.</p>\r\n<h3>Best
      practice #5: Bust freeloading cheaters</h3>\r\n<p>You have worked hard to create
      a high-value free squeeze item. You nicely request the prospect’s information
      only to receive a@a.com or none@atyourbusiness.com. If you allow the user to
      type anything into your contact form and then be linked to the goodies, you
      will be sorry.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, email the item to the same email which the
      user inputs into your contact form. This is not difficult for programmers and
      it will cut your bad leads to zero.</p>"

      website does not need a graphical upgrade, here are a few tips to manage the
      process in the future. Re-designing a website is much like a construction project.
      There is an architect, a general contractor, and a bunch of subs. Of course,
      the more complex the website, the more subs that are needed. You have five methods
      in which to work with web providers:</p>\r\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid;

      practices</h2>\r\n<h3>Best practice #1: Overspending beats under spending.</h3>\r\n<p>Your
      website is a good-looking front door to your company. Whether you get a lot
      of traffic or not, your website helps you gain customers. If even a portion
      of your website is unprofessional or unattractive, a prospect surfing your website
      could say, &quot;these guys don’t look that professional.&quot; If so, the prospect
      may excuse you from the buying process before you even have a shot.</p>\r\n<p>Better
      to spend a few thousand dollars too much for your website than to lose prospects.</p>\r\n<h3>Best
      practice #2: White Sells Version 2.0</h3>\r\n<p>The old saying in advertising
      was &quot;white sells.&quot; The point was that too much copy cluttered the
      message and actually hurt selling. On the web the same is true; too much text
      hurts sales. However, on the web, substitute pictures, graphics and video for
      white.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever possible, use video or pictures instead of words.
      In our time-starved world, no one reads anymore.</p>\r\n<h3>Best practice #3:
      Free beats cheap... by a lot!</h3>\r\n<p>In his book <span style=\"text-decoration:
      underline;\">Free: The Future of Radical Price</span>, author Chris Anderson
      (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Long Tail</span>) performs
      a study on the power of free. Here’s the experiment:</p>\r\n<p>Test 1: A large
      group of people is offered a Hersey’s Kiss (fair market value $0.15) for a penny
      or a chocolate truffle (fair market value $1) for $0.15. Results: Over 70% of
      the participants choose the $0.15 underpriced truffle.</p>\r\n<p>Test 2: The
      price of each chocolate is dropped one cent. The same group is offered the Kiss
      for free and the truffle for $0.14. The results flipped: 70+ percent now chose
      the Kiss. That’s the power of free!</p>\r\n<h3>Best practice #4: $50 worth of
      free</h3>\r\n<p>Internet gurus recommend that your free item have a perceived
      value of $50. Right now you are probably saying, &quot;What?&quot; Don’t panic,
      it is perceived value, not cost or sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of high value
      free items include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>White papers</li>\r\n\t<li>Special
      reports</li>\r\n\t<li>Video Tutorials</li>\r\n\t<li>Insider tips newsletter</li>\r\n\t<li>Conference
      admission</li>\r\n\t<li>One-on-one consultation</li>\r\n\t<li>Assessment or
      quiz (robust enough to be valued at $50)</li>\r\n\t<li>Webinar (live or replay)</li>\r\n\t<li>Useful
      template or form</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These free items are typically called &quot;squeeze
      items.&quot; The object is to offer something valuable enough to squeeze the
      email address from the prospect. It takes a $50 item to get most people’s email.</p>\r\n<h3>Best
      practice #5: Bust freeloading cheaters</h3>\r\n<p>You have worked hard to create
      a high-value free squeeze item. You nicely request the prospect’s information
      only to receive a@a.com or none@atyourbusiness.com. If you allow the user to
      type anything into your contact form and then be linked to the goodies, you
      will be sorry.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, email the item to the same email which the
      user inputs into your contact form. This is not difficult for programmers and
      it will cut your bad leads to zero.</p>"

      or Upgrade your social media presence. If you do not have a Twitter page, LinkedIn
      page, or Facebook page, create them. If you are starting at point zero, here
      are some options:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Hire a social media professional to create
      your pages and profiles. This should cost under $1000 for most companies.</li>\r\n\t<li>Do
      it yourself. Even if you are not a computer pro, you should be able to set up
      these pages with the help of online tools or a few good Google searches. In
      5-10 hours you can have all your pages complete and will have learned much about
      social media.</li>\r\n\t<li>Find a partner. Misery loves company. If you are
      finding yourself dreading this task, then find a partner. Buddy up with either
      someone more advanced or someone in the same boat. It doesn’t matter. Meetup
      groups could be a good place to connect with someone.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>If
      you have a Twitter page, you can improve it by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>When you
      read an online article that could interest your prospects, tweet it</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tUse
      a custom background rather than the generic ones provided. There are many free
      options. Just Google &quot;Free twitter background.&quot; If you really want
      to get fancy, you can create a custom background for a few bucks.\r\n\t\t<div
      style=\"height: 300px; overflow: hidden;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"float: left;
      font-size: 14pt; margin: 10px; text-align: center; width: 430px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\tStandard

      background -->\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Follow to get
      followed. A common practice is to find people you would like to follow you and
      follow them first. Typically, 20% will follow you back.</li>\r\n\t<li>Decide
      if you need guru status. Gurus have thousands of followers and only follow a
      few people. Typically, these people are celebrities, public figures, or well-regarded
      experts. It is quite difficult to build 10,000 followers without following back.
      If you will follow others back when they follow you, you can grow your following
      much quicker. However, if you have 5000 followers and follow 5000, you may not
      be seen as a guru.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use lists. Lists allow you to categorize your
      Tweets for easier consumption. For instance, if user @Mule_kick writes about
      a topic of interest such as business models, create a list called &quot;business
      models.&quot;</li>\r\n\t<li>Retweet. If you get an interesting Tweet, simply
      re-Tweet it. In the Twitter world, more activity is generally better.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If
      you have a LinkedIn page</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Get your profile gauge to 100%.
      You will see a completeness gauge showing how much of your profile is complete.
      Keep going until you get 100%. It’s not that difficult.<br /><!-- linkedin image
      --></li>\r\n\t<li>Join 5-10 groups. There are over 20,000 groups on LinkedIn.
      Find a few interesting ones and subscribe. You don’t need to participate in
      the discussion at first, but eventually jump into a conversation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Link
      to your blog. If you have a blog, you can feed it to your LinkedIn page using
      Feedburner. This will keep your page fresh and be almost no work.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use
      your personal picture, not a logo. LinkedIn is about people connecting to people.
      It’s hard to feel connected to a company if you are not Apple.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don’t
      forget that LinkedIn can be a great place to recruit employees. You have resumes
      right in front of you. Search them.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPick a connection
      strategy. There are three basic connection strategies:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Connect
      to everyone. It is not recommended to connect with anyone and everyone. Sure,
      your connection numbers will look great, but eventually someone will ask, &quot;Hey,
      I saw that you know Mary Jones, can you introduce me.&quot; It may be quite
      embarrassing if you don’t know who Mary Jones is.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Connect
      to only your most trusted personal network. LinkedIn is great for leveraging
      the power of real-world networks. However, this strategy may leave some benefits
      on the table. Instead, loosen up the standard a bit and connect to people you
      have met but may not be lifelong friends.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Liberal connecting
      with actual connections. You should not connect with anyone you have not met
      or spoken with. In fact, you probably should not connect with someone that will
      not remember you or vica verse. However, if you can clear that bar, connect
      away. The upside exceeds the downside.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If
      you have a Facebook fan page</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Get more fans. Virality is
      over-rated if you are not Lady Gaga. 99% of businesses have to WORK for likes.
      Remember the old days trying to get customers to write testimonial letters.
      You had to scratch and claw to get them. The same is true for Facebook likes.
      Many companies are offering small bribes to get them. $5 off your next pizza
      if you like Bob’s Pizzeria. Ideally, you should have 1000 or more fans.<br /><!--
      facebook image --></li>\r\n\t<li>Feed your blog into Facebook. Use Feedburner
      to automatically enter new blog posts on your wall.</li>\r\n\t<li>Make friends.
      Customers go to your Facebook page, then they check out how many friends and
      likes you have. This is that &quot;social currency&quot; you keep hearing about.
      Not enough friends or likes and something must be wrong.</li>\r\n\t<li>Think
      of Facebook as free couponing. Kohl’s Department stores has over 1 million Facebook
      friends. Why? Kohl’s sends special deals to its Facebook friends. Instead of
      printing a coupon book, mailing it, and paying for postage, Kohl clicks a few
      buttons and gets 1 million coupons distributed for free by Facebook. Not bad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Best
      Practices</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Follow then get followed on Twitter. This is
      an easy way to grow relevant colleagues.</li>\r\n\t<li>Blog. Yes, I know- you
      don’t like to write. You don’t know what to say. Do it anyway. One post a month
      will do. If you really hate to write, use Feedburner to pull good blogs into
      yours. For instance, if you wanted to have all the posts for the Business Model
      Institute appear in your blog automatically, use Feedburner feed <a href=\"http://feedburner.com/businessmodelinstitute\">http://feedburner.com/businessmodelinstitute</a>
      You can search feedburner.com for all the blogs available to feed.</li>\r\n\t<li>No
      one cares what you had for lunch. Please don’t Tweet just to Tweet.</li>\r\n\t<li>Connect,
      not sell. Join the conversation as if you have nothing to sell. Be patient and
      the sales will find you.</li>\r\n\t<li>Answer questions on LinkedIn. The groups
      you join will have questions. Create well-thought-out answers to an occasional
      question. If your answer is selected &quot;best,&quot; this can create some
      nice social currency.</li>\r\n\t<li>Virality doesn’t just happen, you have to
      work it. Facebook games user bases grow 50% per month... only once they have
      hit 100,000 users. They have to scrape, claw, borrow and steal to get to 100,000
      users.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use custom backgrounds. They are cheap and free. Don’t
      be generic.</li>\r\n</ul>"

      a custom background rather than the generic ones provided. There are many free
      options. Just Google &quot;Free twitter background.&quot; If you really want
      to get fancy, you can create a custom background for a few bucks.\r\n\t\t<div

      followed. A common practice is to find people you would like to follow you and
      follow them first. Typically, 20% will follow you back.</li>\r\n\t<li>Decide
      if you need guru status. Gurus have thousands of followers and only follow a
      few people. Typically, these people are celebrities, public figures, or well-regarded
      experts. It is quite difficult to build 10,000 followers without following back.
      If you will follow others back when they follow you, you can grow your following
      much quicker. However, if you have 5000 followers and follow 5000, you may not
      be seen as a guru.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use lists. Lists allow you to categorize your
      Tweets for easier consumption. For instance, if user @Mule_kick writes about
      a topic of interest such as business models, create a list called &quot;business
      models.&quot;</li>\r\n\t<li>Retweet. If you get an interesting Tweet, simply
      re-Tweet it. In the Twitter world, more activity is generally better.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If
      you have a LinkedIn page</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Get your profile gauge to 100%.
      You will see a completeness gauge showing how much of your profile is complete.
      Keep going until you get 100%. It’s not that difficult.<br /><!-- linkedin image
      --></li>\r\n\t<li>Join 5-10 groups. There are over 20,000 groups on LinkedIn.
      Find a few interesting ones and subscribe. You don’t need to participate in
      the discussion at first, but eventually jump into a conversation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Link
      to your blog. If you have a blog, you can feed it to your LinkedIn page using
      Feedburner. This will keep your page fresh and be almost no work.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use
      your personal picture, not a logo. LinkedIn is about people connecting to people.
      It’s hard to feel connected to a company if you are not Apple.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don’t
      forget that LinkedIn can be a great place to recruit employees. You have resumes
      right in front of you. Search them.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPick a connection
      strategy. There are three basic connection strategies:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Connect
      to everyone. It is not recommended to connect with anyone and everyone. Sure,
      your connection numbers will look great, but eventually someone will ask, &quot;Hey,
      I saw that you know Mary Jones, can you introduce me.&quot; It may be quite
      embarrassing if you don’t know who Mary Jones is.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Connect
      to only your most trusted personal network. LinkedIn is great for leveraging
      the power of real-world networks. However, this strategy may leave some benefits
      on the table. Instead, loosen up the standard a bit and connect to people you
      have met but may not be lifelong friends.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Liberal connecting
      with actual connections. You should not connect with anyone you have not met
      or spoken with. In fact, you probably should not connect with someone that will
      not remember you or vica verse. However, if you can clear that bar, connect
      away. The upside exceeds the downside.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If
      you have a Facebook fan page</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Get more fans. Virality is
      over-rated if you are not Lady Gaga. 99% of businesses have to WORK for likes.
      Remember the old days trying to get customers to write testimonial letters.
      You had to scratch and claw to get them. The same is true for Facebook likes.
      Many companies are offering small bribes to get them. $5 off your next pizza
      if you like Bob’s Pizzeria. Ideally, you should have 1000 or more fans.<br /><!--
      facebook image --></li>\r\n\t<li>Feed your blog into Facebook. Use Feedburner
      to automatically enter new blog posts on your wall.</li>\r\n\t<li>Make friends.
      Customers go to your Facebook page, then they check out how many friends and
      likes you have. This is that &quot;social currency&quot; you keep hearing about.
      Not enough friends or likes and something must be wrong.</li>\r\n\t<li>Think
      of Facebook as free couponing. Kohl’s Department stores has over 1 million Facebook
      friends. Why? Kohl’s sends special deals to its Facebook friends. Instead of
      printing a coupon book, mailing it, and paying for postage, Kohl clicks a few
      buttons and gets 1 million coupons distributed for free by Facebook. Not bad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Best
      Practices</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Follow then get followed on Twitter. This is
      an easy way to grow relevant colleagues.</li>\r\n\t<li>Blog. Yes, I know- you
      don’t like to write. You don’t know what to say. Do it anyway. One post a month
      will do. If you really hate to write, use Feedburner to pull good blogs into
      yours. For instance, if you wanted to have all the posts for the Business Model
      Institute appear in your blog automatically, use Feedburner feed <a href=\"http://feedburner.com/businessmodelinstitute\">http://feedburner.com/businessmodelinstitute</a>
      You can search feedburner.com for all the blogs available to feed.</li>\r\n\t<li>No
      one cares what you had for lunch. Please don’t Tweet just to Tweet.</li>\r\n\t<li>Connect,
      not sell. Join the conversation as if you have nothing to sell. Be patient and
      the sales will find you.</li>\r\n\t<li>Answer questions on LinkedIn. The groups
      you join will have questions. Create well-thought-out answers to an occasional
      question. If your answer is selected &quot;best,&quot; this can create some
      nice social currency.</li>\r\n\t<li>Virality doesn’t just happen, you have to
      work it. Facebook games user bases grow 50% per month... only once they have
      hit 100,000 users. They have to scrape, claw, borrow and steal to get to 100,000
      users.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use custom backgrounds. They are cheap and free. Don’t
      be generic.</li>\r\n</ul>"

      start with some quick background. If you are a pro, skip ahead. Search Engine
      Optimization (SEO) is the process of moving your website to the top of the Google
      search rankings. This process is &frac34; science and &frac14; magic as Google
      is extremely secretive regarding their search algorithm. Search engine pros
      try to figure out Google’s methods so they can work the algorithm to their client’s
      advantage. At the same time, Google constantly changes the search algorithm
      to maintain its proprietary nature. At times, these sudden changes by Google
      can wreak havoc. Many companies have held top three spots on Google only to
      drop to obscurity when Google changes its search algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Most SEO
      experts want your key search results on the first page. For instance, if you
      are a plumber in Boston, a key search phrase might be &quot;plumber Boston&quot;
      or plumbers Boston.&quot; You would want to appear on page one for Google searches.</p>\r\n<p>However,
      many SEO professionals go one step further and desire a listing &quot;above
      the fold&quot; on the first page. Typically, this is in the top 4-6 results
      depending on screen size. See the screenshot below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
      center;\"><!-- google fold image --></p>\r\n<p>The science of SEO is devoted
      moving websites up the Google rankings. There is no right answer as to how Google
      ranks websites. For an educated guess see http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/internet/google-ranking-factors.htm.</p>\r\n<h2>Google
      Page Rank</h2>\r\n<p>PageRank is a Google-generated numeric value that represents
      how important your page is on the web. Google assumes that when one page links
      to another, it is effectively &quot;voting&quot; for the other page. The more
      votes that are cast for a page, the more important that page is assumed to be.
      Also, there is a voter weighting factor. The importance of the page casting
      the vote weights how important the vote itself is. Google calculates a page's
      importance from the weighted value of the votes cast for it. PageRank is Google's
      way of deciding a page's importance. This matters because it is one of the more
      important factors determining a page's ranking in the free search results (SEO).
      It isn't the only factor that Google uses to rank pages, but it is an important
      one.</p>\r\n<h2>Google vs. Bing/Yahoo</h2>\r\n<p>Many experts recommend monitoring
      Google rankings only. Google accounts for over 70% of all search traffic. The
      experts claim that if you raise your Google rankings, Yahoo and Bing will rise
      as well. We recommend this strategy as well as typically the bulk of the benefit
      lies with Google and Yahoo/Bing rankings tend to rise 2-3 months after Google
      rankings rise.</p>\r\n<p>Google tends to be more prevalent in the B2B environment.
      Many B2B webistes choose to ignore Yahoo altogether. However, if you sell to
      consumers, particularly young consumers, Yahoo search results cannot be ignored.</p>\r\n<h2>RankPay</h2>\r\n<p>One
      of the easiest methods to assess your current SEO position is to use RankPay.
      Simply input your top three search phases and RankPay will tell you how much
      it will cost to move into the top 3 results and the difficulty. Ideally, the
      cost should be under $300 for most words. If the cost is significantly more
      than $300, discuss with your coach. Click here to learn more about Rank Pay.</p>\r\n<h2>Pay
      Per Click (PPC)</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies ignore PPC advertising as unnecessary.
      This is simply not true. Every company needs some PPC advertising. Many CEOs
      think that PPC advertising is cost ineffective or unneeded. Here is a list of
      reasons to use PPC advertising:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Minimum cost per click
      of $0.10 for many keywords.</li>\r\n\t<li>Low cost for low volume phrases.</li>\r\n\t<li>Buying
      your way onto Page 1 when SEO cannot get you there.</li>\r\n\t<li>Reputation
      management. What does a client or prospect think when they do a search for something
      they think you should appear on, but you don’t? Buying your way onto page 1
      through PPC solves this.</li>\r\n\t<li>Appearing on searches for your competitors.
      Yes, buy their name.</li>\r\n\t<li>It’s fast. You can run ads in a matter of
      minutes and get traffic immediately.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!--
      google search results image -->\r\n<p class=\"section-status\">[domain] scored
      below average on this aspect. The factors we have analyzed to arrive at this
      conclusion are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>How important is it to rank highly in Google
      search results for your top 3 phrases?</li>\r\n\t<li>Where do you rank in Google
      search results?</li>\r\n\t<li>Where to you rank in Google PPC results?</li>\r\n\t<li>What
      is the likelihood you can move up the Google rankings if your ranking is currently
      low?</li>\r\n\t<li>How effective is your inbound linking?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do you
      have enough high quality links from authoritative sites and high Page Rank sites?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In
      order to improve your score, you should consider the following options:</p>\r\n<p>Use
      the Google keyword tool to pick your best three phrases. The best phrases may
      not necessarily be the highest search volume phrases. For instance, if you started
      a new sales training site, you would have a very difficult time getting to the
      first page of Google for the term &quot;sales training.&quot; Yes, this is the
      highest volume search phrase, but it also is the most competitive. Well entrenched
      competitors have a ten year head start on you. It may be close to impossible
      or financially prohibitive to chase this phrase. Instead, look to secondary
      search terms you CAN win. Perhaps &quot;sales training Seattle&quot; or &quot;bridal
      sales training&quot; are better phrases. Typically, it is more effective to
      get into the top 3 results for lesser volume phrases than to fight an unwinnable
      battle for the obvious high volume words. The best phrases combine these factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Search
      volume: the higher the better</li>\r\n\t<li>Competitiveness: The lower the better</li>\r\n\t<li>Increase
      in search volume: Ideally, this should be going up</li>\r\n\t<li>Cost per click:
      The higher the better as we will be getting these clicks for free. No point
      winning a click we can buy for $0.05</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can use <a href=\"http://www.wordtracker.com/\">Wordtracker’s</a>
      service to find the best &quot;sleeper&quot; phrases. Wordtracker combines many
      of the factors above and creates a score for the phrase. The higher the score
      the better. However, many clients have found success with phrases with low Wordtracker
      scores. Like any tool, use Wordtracker combined with your own common sense.</p>\r\n<p>Set
      up Google Analytics on your site. This is a terrific service from Google and
      it’s free. You can not only see your traffic, but Google Analytics shows you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>%
      new visitors</li>\r\n\t<li>Average time spent on site</li>\r\n\t<li>Average
      pages viewed per site</li>\r\n\t<li>A graph of site visits over time</li>\r\n\t<li>Bounce

      up for Google Adwords (PPC) if you haven’t already. If you are not currently
      spending, set a $50/month budget and play around a bit. Beware; there is more
      science to PPC than you might think. However, let’s save these finer points
      for round two. At the beginning, try to buy clicks under $1 each. It’s hard
      to get burned with cheap traffic. If you have to spend more, go to $2/click
      but check stats every day. You do not want to know how many clients experimented
      with Google only to spend $1000 in 7 hours.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, your Adwords
      account should be linked to your Google Analytics account. Once you do this,
      you can better track the effectiveness of your PPC campaigns and track paid
      clicks all the way to purchase, not just whether they visited the site. Effectively,
      Google Analytics will tag the PPC visitor all the way through their visit and
      let you know how well you are monetizing your paid traffic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!--
      adwords image --></p>\r\n<p>Consider a graphics web upgrade. A better looking
      website isn’t that expensive. Just do it!</p>\r\n<p>Three options for implementation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Method
      #1- Hire a consultant and turn over the keys. That is have someone Do It For
      You (DIF). There are plenty of great web people who can execute everything on
      this list. Here are some ballpark costs for quality consultants:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Website
      $3000+</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>SEO $250 - $5000 per month</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>PPC $200
      - $5000 per month</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Link building services $250 - $1000 per
      month</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Upgrade graphics $30- $75/hour</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Video
      production and editing $125/hour</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Copywriting $40-$300 per
      hour</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Method #2: Do it yourself (DIY)\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>The
      good news: it's free.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>The bad news: it's probably going to
      take a very long time and perhaps never get done. In addition, what other work
      suffers as you focus on the website?</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Method
      #3: Do it with (DIW)\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>For most entrepreneurs, this is
      the best option. Pay a small amount of money to someone that knows more than
      you and can direct the process but not constantly be on the clock. You will
      fill the role of project manager and doer of some work. Your DIW partner will
      provide the direction and vision.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>This method tends to be
      the best blend of cost and speed</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Best
      Practices</h2>\r\n<h3>Get listed in Google Places</h3>\r\n<p>Google places listed
      tend to appear at the top of Google searches. Even if you are not a retail business
      you should list your business in Google Places. Here's why:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It's
      free</li>\r\n\t<li>What does a prospect think if they search for you and you
      do NOT appear? Are you out of business?</li>\r\n\t<li>You get a free, high quality
      linkback from Google to your website</li>\r\n\t<li>It takes 3 minutes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p
      class=\"center\"><!-- google search image -->\r\n<h3>Free directory links</h3>\r\n<p>Free
      directory listings are also available at many online Yellow Page type sites.
      Most of these are also free. If a site is not free, skip it. Here are a few
      to get listed on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>yeloow.com</li>\r\n\t<li>yellowpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>superpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>onlineyellowpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>realpageslive.com</li>\r\n\t<li>brightpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>Note:
      be consistent with your link. Always use http://abc.com or http://www.abc.com.
      Do not mix them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Avoid article sites and link farms</h3>\r\n<p>Google
      has decided that ezine directories and many article sites are NOT high content
      and has greatly decreased the importance of such sites. For the most part, our
      recommendation is to either 1) get your articles in legitimate, mainstream media
      or 2) put your articles on your own blog and search engine optimize them.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid
      duplicate content</h3>\r\n<p>Google hates duplicate content. You may be thinking,
      I don't have any. What if you have 200 products on your website and the first
      two lines of each product page is a general company description? Google would
      view these pages as practically the same. The beginning of a page is weighted
      more than the other section. When Google reads these pages, it may think the
      content is too similar and punish you.</p>\r\n<p>In general, avoid copy and
      pasting is the easiest way to avoid duplicate content.</p>\r\n<p>Stay away from
      content creation programs. These programs take an article or blog post and automatically
      generate ten &quot;varied&quot; posts. If Google has not already caught on to
      these, they will.</p>\r\n<h3>Leverage H1, H2 tags</h3>\r\n<p>An H1 tag is the
      largest size font on your website. Typically this is the title. Google places
      extra weight on H1 tags as Google feels that big type is being emphasized and
      is therefore more important. May sure your H1 tags are used and include your
      most important keywords.</p>\r\n<p>An H2 tag is the next largest font. These
      could include heading titles and other emphasized fonts. Google weights H2 tags
      as well, but not as heavily. Make sure your H2 tags are set and include your
      keywords.</p>\r\n<h3>Frequent changes</h3>\r\n<p>Google loves freshness. The
      more often you change or add content, the more Google will reward you. The easiest
      way to determine this is to check the last date Google crawled your site. You
      can find this date in the Google Webmaster Tools.</p>\r\n<h3>Google likes lots
      of pages</h3>\r\n<p>Caveat: You may be tempted to juke the system. Many software
      tools are available to modify existing content and create a new page. Google
      hates this and has teams of smart people working to punish cheaters. If they
      have not figured out how to catch it yet, they will. Google is not hard to figure
      out, it is just hard to execute. Google wants LOTS and LOTS of fresh, original,
      high-quality content with no advertising. That is not to say you must follow
      these standards. We are simply pointing out that Google rewards websites that
      do what Google wants.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to give Google what they want
      without going Black Hat is to simply create a new page if in doubt. Instead
      of one long page with two themes, break it in two.</p>\r\n<p>Add pictures. Creating
      more pages tends to make pages short. Add pictures to make pages appear longer.</p>\r\n<p>Add
      a blog. Most business owners whine when we suggest a blog. It is awfully easy
      to add a WordPress blog to any website. You don't need to write much to get
      benefit. No one even needs to read it for you to benefit. The beauty of a WordPress
      blog is that each blog post is a new page. Comments added to a blog get a separate
      page. Basically, WordPress is a legitimate, page generating machine. If you
      don't know what to put in a blog, simply treat it like a private forum for your
      press releases. If you hire someone, blog it. If you add a new product, blog
      it. If you attend a trade show, blog it.</p>\r\n<h3>Adwords Editor</h3>\r\n<p>It
      is difficult to imagine any business not needing Google pay-per-click advertising
      (PPC)? PPC is an immediate method to jump to the top of any search. While SEO
      takes months or years to move to the top, all it takes is money to get to the
      top of PPC.</p>\r\n<p>At a minimum, purchase your own company name and the names
      of a few competitors. These words are cheap and can be highly effective.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you manage many keywords, you may find the Google Adwords Editor tool to be
      handy. This is a free program you can download from Google. The program is local
      to your machine, so you can manage your account without access to the internet.
      Also, many people like the spreadsheet-like interface better than the web version.</p>\r\n<p>Most
      clients find that the online version of Google Adwords is better for some tasks
      and the Adwords Editor is better for others. In particular, the Adwords Editor
      is better for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mass changing of settings across multiple
      campaigns</li>\r\n\t<li>Viewing keywords vs. campaigns</li>\r\n\t<li>Changing
      bid prices</li>\r\n\t<li>View certain reports</li>\r\n\t<li>Adding new keywords</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Use
      Video</h3>\r\n<p>Google loves video, especially YouTube videos.</p>\r\n<p>Simply
      put, posting videos to YouTube is the fastest way to the top of Google.</p>\r\n<p>In
      this ADD world, people don't read. Ask yourself, are you more likely to click
      the videos in the screenshot below, or click the articles? Most people will
      listen to or view a video.</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!-- google search with
      video results image --></p>\r\n<p>No excuses. 95% of our clients have not shot
      enough video. The stated reason is: &quot;I don't know what to say.&quot; Really?
      If we put a client in front of you and asked you to talk about your company
      or product, you could not do it? It's the same thing, just talk to the camera.
      YouTube is terrific, studio quality isn't expected and sometimes, studio quality
      can hurt. Over-produced video sends the wrong message sometimes. Make sure the
      mood of your video is reflected in the production quality.</p>"

      start with some quick background. If you are a pro, skip ahead. Search Engine
      Optimization (SEO) is the process of moving your website to the top of the Google
      search rankings. This process is &frac34; science and &frac14; magic as Google
      is extremely secretive regarding their search algorithm. Search engine pros
      try to figure out Google’s methods so they can work the algorithm to their client’s
      advantage. At the same time, Google constantly changes the search algorithm
      to maintain its proprietary nature. At times, these sudden changes by Google
      can wreak havoc. Many companies have held top three spots on Google only to
      drop to obscurity when Google changes its search algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Most SEO
      experts want your key search results on the first page. For instance, if you
      are a plumber in Boston, a key search phrase might be &quot;plumber Boston&quot;
      or plumbers Boston.&quot; You would want to appear on page one for Google searches.</p>\r\n<p>However,
      many SEO professionals go one step further and desire a listing &quot;above
      the fold&quot; on the first page. Typically, this is in the top 4-6 results
      depending on screen size. See the screenshot below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
      center;\"><!-- google fold image --></p>\r\n<p>The science of SEO is devoted
      moving websites up the Google rankings. There is no right answer as to how Google
      ranks websites. For an educated guess see http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/internet/google-ranking-factors.htm.</p>\r\n<h2>Google

      but check stats every day. You do not want to know how many clients experimented
      with Google only to spend $1000 in 7 hours.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, your Adwords
      account should be linked to your Google Analytics account. Once you do this,
      you can better track the effectiveness of your PPC campaigns and track paid
      clicks all the way to purchase, not just whether they visited the site. Effectively,
      Google Analytics will tag the PPC visitor all the way through their visit and
      let you know how well you are monetizing your paid traffic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!--

      good news: it's free.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>The bad news: it's probably going to
      take a very long time and perhaps never get done. In addition, what other work
      suffers as you focus on the website?</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Method
      #3: Do it with (DIW)\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>For most entrepreneurs, this is
      the best option. Pay a small amount of money to someone that knows more than
      you and can direct the process but not constantly be on the clock. You will
      fill the role of project manager and doer of some work. Your DIW partner will
      provide the direction and vision.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>This method tends to be
      the best blend of cost and speed</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Best
      Practices</h2>\r\n<h3>Get listed in Google Places</h3>\r\n<p>Google places listed
      tend to appear at the top of Google searches. Even if you are not a retail business
      you should list your business in Google Places. Here's why:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It's
      free</li>\r\n\t<li>What does a prospect think if they search for you and you
      do NOT appear? Are you out of business?</li>\r\n\t<li>You get a free, high quality
      linkback from Google to your website</li>\r\n\t<li>It takes 3 minutes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p
      class=\"center\"><!-- google search image -->\r\n<h3>Free directory links</h3>\r\n<p>Free
      directory listings are also available at many online Yellow Page type sites.
      Most of these are also free. If a site is not free, skip it. Here are a few
      to get listed on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>yeloow.com</li>\r\n\t<li>yellowpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>superpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>onlineyellowpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>realpageslive.com</li>\r\n\t<li>brightpages.com</li>\r\n\t<li>Note:
      be consistent with your link. Always use http://abc.com or http://www.abc.com.
      Do not mix them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Avoid article sites and link farms</h3>\r\n<p>Google
      has decided that ezine directories and many article sites are NOT high content
      and has greatly decreased the importance of such sites. For the most part, our
      recommendation is to either 1) get your articles in legitimate, mainstream media
      or 2) put your articles on your own blog and search engine optimize them.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid
      duplicate content</h3>\r\n<p>Google hates duplicate content. You may be thinking,
      I don't have any. What if you have 200 products on your website and the first
      two lines of each product page is a general company description? Google would
      view these pages as practically the same. The beginning of a page is weighted
      more than the other section. When Google reads these pages, it may think the
      content is too similar and punish you.</p>\r\n<p>In general, avoid copy and
      pasting is the easiest way to avoid duplicate content.</p>\r\n<p>Stay away from
      content creation programs. These programs take an article or blog post and automatically
      generate ten &quot;varied&quot; posts. If Google has not already caught on to
      these, they will.</p>\r\n<h3>Leverage H1, H2 tags</h3>\r\n<p>An H1 tag is the
      largest size font on your website. Typically this is the title. Google places
      extra weight on H1 tags as Google feels that big type is being emphasized and
      is therefore more important. May sure your H1 tags are used and include your
      most important keywords.</p>\r\n<p>An H2 tag is the next largest font. These
      could include heading titles and other emphasized fonts. Google weights H2 tags
      as well, but not as heavily. Make sure your H2 tags are set and include your
      keywords.</p>\r\n<h3>Frequent changes</h3>\r\n<p>Google loves freshness. The
      more often you change or add content, the more Google will reward you. The easiest
      way to determine this is to check the last date Google crawled your site. You
      can find this date in the Google Webmaster Tools.</p>\r\n<h3>Google likes lots
      of pages</h3>\r\n<p>Caveat: You may be tempted to juke the system. Many software
      tools are available to modify existing content and create a new page. Google
      hates this and has teams of smart people working to punish cheaters. If they
      have not figured out how to catch it yet, they will. Google is not hard to figure
      out, it is just hard to execute. Google wants LOTS and LOTS of fresh, original,
      high-quality content with no advertising. That is not to say you must follow
      these standards. We are simply pointing out that Google rewards websites that
      do what Google wants.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to give Google what they want
      without going Black Hat is to simply create a new page if in doubt. Instead
      of one long page with two themes, break it in two.</p>\r\n<p>Add pictures. Creating
      more pages tends to make pages short. Add pictures to make pages appear longer.</p>\r\n<p>Add
      a blog. Most business owners whine when we suggest a blog. It is awfully easy
      to add a WordPress blog to any website. You don't need to write much to get
      benefit. No one even needs to read it for you to benefit. The beauty of a WordPress
      blog is that each blog post is a new page. Comments added to a blog get a separate
      page. Basically, WordPress is a legitimate, page generating machine. If you
      don't know what to put in a blog, simply treat it like a private forum for your
      press releases. If you hire someone, blog it. If you add a new product, blog
      it. If you attend a trade show, blog it.</p>\r\n<h3>Adwords Editor</h3>\r\n<p>It
      is difficult to imagine any business not needing Google pay-per-click advertising
      (PPC)? PPC is an immediate method to jump to the top of any search. While SEO
      takes months or years to move to the top, all it takes is money to get to the
      top of PPC.</p>\r\n<p>At a minimum, purchase your own company name and the names
      of a few competitors. These words are cheap and can be highly effective.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you manage many keywords, you may find the Google Adwords Editor tool to be
      handy. This is a free program you can download from Google. The program is local
      to your machine, so you can manage your account without access to the internet.
      Also, many people like the spreadsheet-like interface better than the web version.</p>\r\n<p>Most
      clients find that the online version of Google Adwords is better for some tasks
      and the Adwords Editor is better for others. In particular, the Adwords Editor
      is better for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mass changing of settings across multiple
      campaigns</li>\r\n\t<li>Viewing keywords vs. campaigns</li>\r\n\t<li>Changing
      bid prices</li>\r\n\t<li>View certain reports</li>\r\n\t<li>Adding new keywords</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Use
      Video</h3>\r\n<p>Google loves video, especially YouTube videos.</p>\r\n<p>Simply
      put, posting videos to YouTube is the fastest way to the top of Google.</p>\r\n<p>In
      this ADD world, people don't read. Ask yourself, are you more likely to click
      the videos in the screenshot below, or click the articles? Most people will
      listen to or view a video.</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!-- google search with
      video results image --></p>\r\n<p>No excuses. 95% of our clients have not shot
      enough video. The stated reason is: &quot;I don't know what to say.&quot; Really?
      If we put a client in front of you and asked you to talk about your company
      or product, you could not do it? It's the same thing, just talk to the camera.
      YouTube is terrific, studio quality isn't expected and sometimes, studio quality
      can hurt. Over-produced video sends the wrong message sometimes. Make sure the
      mood of your video is reflected in the production quality.</p>"

    - ! "<p class=\"section-status\">You scored above average on this section.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s
      start with some quick background. If you are a pro, skip ahead. Search Engine
      Optimization (SEO) is the process of moving your website to the top of the Google
      search rankings. This process is &frac34; science and &frac14; magic as Google
      is extremely secretive regarding their search algorithm. Search engine pros
      try to figure out Google’s methods so they can work the algorithm to their client’s
      advantage. At the same time, Google constantly changes the search algorithm
      to maintain its proprietary nature. At times, these sudden changes by Google
      can wreak havoc. Many companies have held top three spots on Google only to
      drop to obscurity when Google changes its search algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Most SEO
      experts want your key search results on the first page. For instance, if you
      are a plumber in Boston, a key search phrase might be &quot;plumber Boston&quot;
      or plumbers Boston.&quot; You would want to appear on page one for Google searches.</p>\r\n<p>However,
      many SEO professionals go one step further and desire a listing &quot;above
      the fold&quot; on the first page. Typically, this is in the top 4-6 results
      depending on screen size. See the screenshot below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
      center;\"><!-- google fold image --></p>\r\n<p>The science of SEO is devoted
      moving websites up the Google rankings. There is no right answer as to how Google
      ranks websites. For an educated guess see http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/internet/google-ranking-factors.htm.</p>\r\n<h2>Google
      Page Rank</h2>\r\n<p>PageRank is a Google-generated numeric value that represents
      how important your page is on the web. Google assumes that when one page links
      to another, it is effectively &quot;voting&quot; for the other page. The more
      votes that are cast for a page, the more important that page is assumed to be.
      Also, there is a voter weighting factor. The importance of the page casting
      the vote weights how important the vote itself is. Google calculates a page's
      importance from the weighted value of the votes cast for it. PageRank is Google's
      way of deciding a page's importance. This matters because it is one of the more
      important factors determining a page's ranking in the free search results (SEO).
      It isn't the only factor that Google uses to rank pages, but it is an important
      one.</p>\r\n<h2>Google vs. Bing/Yahoo</h2>\r\n<p>Many experts recommend monitoring
      Google rankings only. Google accounts for over 70% of all search traffic. The
      experts claim that if you raise your Google rankings, Yahoo and Bing will rise
      as well. We recommend this strategy as well as typically the bulk of the benefit
      lies with Google and Yahoo/Bing rankings tend to rise 2-3 months after Google
      rankings rise.</p>\r\n<p>Google tends to be more prevalent in the B2B environment.
      Many B2B webistes choose to ignore Yahoo altogether. However, if you sell to
      consumers, particularly young consumers, Yahoo search results cannot be ignored.</p>\r\n<h2>RankPay</h2>\r\n<p>One
      of the easiest methods to assess your current SEO position is to use RankPay.
      Simply input your top three search phases and RankPay will tell you how much
      it will cost to move into the top 3 results and the difficulty. Ideally, the
      cost should be under $300 for most words. If the cost is significantly more
      than $300, discuss with your coach. Click here to learn more about Rank Pay.</p>\r\n<h2>Pay
      Per Click (PPC)</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies ignore PPC advertising as unnecessary.
      This is simply not true. Every company needs some PPC advertising. Many CEOs
      think that PPC advertising is cost ineffective or unneeded. Here is a list of
      reasons to use PPC advertising:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Minimum cost per click
      of $0.10 for many keywords.</li>\r\n\t<li>Low cost for low volume phrases.</li>\r\n\t<li>Buying
      your way onto Page 1 when SEO cannot get you there.</li>\r\n\t<li>Reputation
      management. What does a client or prospect think when they do a search for something
      they think you should appear on, but you don’t? Buying your way onto page 1
      through PPC solves this.</li>\r\n\t<li>Appearing on searches for your competitors.
      Yes, buy their name.</li>\r\n\t<li>It’s fast. You can run ads in a matter of
      minutes and get traffic immediately.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!--
      google search results image -->\r\n<p class=\"section-status\">[domain] scored
      very well on this aspect. The factors we have analyzed to arrive at this conclusion
      are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>How important is it to rank highly in Google search
      results for your top 3 phrases?</li>\r\n\t<li>Where do you rank in Google search
      results?</li>\r\n\t<li>Where to you rank in Google PPC results?</li>\r\n\t<li>What
      is the likelihood you can move up the Google rankings if your ranking is currently
      low?</li>\r\n\t<li>How effective is your inbound linking?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do you
      have enough high quality links from authoritative sites and high Page Rank sites?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To
      improve your score even more, you should consider the following options:</p>\r\n<p>Use
      the Google keyword tool to pick your best three phrases. The best phrases may
      not necessarily be the highest search volume phrases. For instance, if you started
      a new sales training site, you would have a very difficult time getting to the
      first page of Google for the term &quot;sales training.&quot; Yes, this is the
      highest volume search phrase, but it also is the most competitive. Well entrenched
      competitors have a ten year head start on you. It may be close to impossible
      or financially prohibitive to chase this phrase. Instead, look to secondary
      search terms you CAN win. Perhaps &quot;sales training Seattle&quot; or &quot;bridal
      sales training&quot; are better phrases. Typically, it is more effective to
      get into the top 3 results for lesser volume phrases than to fight an unwinnable
      battle for the obvious high volume words. The best phrases combine these factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Search
      volume: the higher the better</li>\r\n\t<li>Competitiveness: The lower the better</li>\r\n\t<li>Increase
      in search volume: Ideally, this should be going up</li>\r\n\t<li>Cost per click:
      The higher the better as we will be getting these clicks for free. No point
      winning a click we can buy for $0.05</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can use <a href=\"http://www.wordtracker.com/\">Wordtracker’s</a>
      service to find the best &quot;sleeper&quot; phrases. Wordtracker combines many
      of the factors above and creates a score for the phrase. The higher the score
      the better. However, many clients have found success with phrases with low Wordtracker
      scores. Like any tool, use Wordtracker combined with your own common sense.</p>\r\n<p>Set
      up Google Analytics on your site. This is a terrific service from Google and
      it’s free. You can not only see your traffic, but Google Analytics shows you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>%
      new visitors</li>\r\n\t<li>Average time spent on site</li>\r\n\t<li>Average
      pages viewed per site</li>\r\n\t<li>A graph of site visits over time</li>\r\n\t<li>Bounce
      rate (the number of visitors who quickly exited the site)</li>\r\n\t<li>Keywords
      on search engines used to find your site</li>\r\n\t<li>Exit pages</li>\r\n\t<li>Click
      paths during the visit</li>\r\n\t<li>Errors in the site</li>\r\n\t<li>And much
      more</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!-- google analytics image --></p>\r\n<p>Sign
      up for Google Adwords (PPC) if you haven’t already. If you are not currently
      spending, set a $50/month budget and play around a bit. Beware; there is more
      science to PPC than you might think. However, let’s save these finer points
      for round two. At the beginning, try to buy clicks under $1 each. It’s hard
      to get burned with cheap traffic. If you have to spend more, go to $2/click
      but check stats every day. You do not want to know how many clients experimented
      with Google only to spend $1000 in 7 hours.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, your Adwords
      account should be linked to your Google Analytics account. Once you do this,
      you can better track the effectiveness of your PPC campaigns and track paid

      out, it is just hard to execute. Google wants LOTS and LOTS of fresh, original,
      high-quality content with no advertising. That is not to say you must follow
      these standards. We are simply pointing out that Google rewards websites that
      do what Google wants.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to give Google what they want
      without going Black Hat is to simply create a new page if in doubt. Instead
      of one long page with two themes, break it in two.</p>\r\n<p>Add pictures. Creating
      more pages tends to make pages short. Add pictures to make pages appear longer.</p>\r\n<p>Add
      a blog. Most business owners whine when we suggest a blog. It is awfully easy
      to add a WordPress blog to any website. You don't need to write much to get
      benefit. No one even needs to read it for you to benefit. The beauty of a WordPress
      blog is that each blog post is a new page. Comments added to a blog get a separate
      page. Basically, WordPress is a legitimate, page generating machine. If you
      don't know what to put in a blog, simply treat it like a private forum for your
      press releases. If you hire someone, blog it. If you add a new product, blog
      it. If you attend a trade show, blog it.</p>\r\n<h3>Adwords Editor</h3>\r\n<p>It
      is difficult to imagine any business not needing Google pay-per-click advertising
      (PPC)? PPC is an immediate method to jump to the top of any search. While SEO
      takes months or years to move to the top, all it takes is money to get to the
      top of PPC.</p>\r\n<p>At a minimum, purchase your own company name and the names
      of a few competitors. These words are cheap and can be highly effective.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you manage many keywords, you may find the Google Adwords Editor tool to be
      handy. This is a free program you can download from Google. The program is local
      to your machine, so you can manage your account without access to the internet.
      Also, many people like the spreadsheet-like interface better than the web version.</p>\r\n<p>Most
      clients find that the online version of Google Adwords is better for some tasks
      and the Adwords Editor is better for others. In particular, the Adwords Editor
      is better for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mass changing of settings across multiple
      campaigns</li>\r\n\t<li>Viewing keywords vs. campaigns</li>\r\n\t<li>Changing
      bid prices</li>\r\n\t<li>View certain reports</li>\r\n\t<li>Adding new keywords</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Use
      Video</h3>\r\n<p>Google loves video, especially YouTube videos.</p>\r\n<p>Simply
      put, posting videos to YouTube is the fastest way to the top of Google.</p>\r\n<p>In
      this ADD world, people don't read. Ask yourself, are you more likely to click
      the videos in the screenshot below, or click the articles? Most people will
      listen to or view a video.</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><!-- google search with
      video results image --></p>\r\n<p>No excuses. 95% of our clients have not shot
      enough video. The stated reason is: &quot;I don't know what to say.&quot; Really?
      If we put a client in front of you and asked you to talk about your company
      or product, you could not do it? It's the same thing, just talk to the camera.
      YouTube is terrific, studio quality isn't expected and sometimes, studio quality
      can hurt. Over-produced video sends the wrong message sometimes. Make sure the
      mood of your video is reflected in the production quality.</p>"

      (its &quot;offerings&quot;) carry a great deal of weight in the eyes of a buyer.
      This is true not only for the buyer's interest in the company as an acquisition
      target, but also for their ability to structure and finance a deal.</p>\r\n<p>A
      company's offerings are not limited just to its specific products or services.
      Instead, offerings should be viewed through the eyes of the customer who sees
      a company's offering as their total buying experience &mdash; before, during,
      and after the transaction. No business is exempt from this rule.</p>\r\n<p>Since
      the past successes of a company's offerings have no bearing on the ability to
      generate future sales, buyers are only interested in the value the market is
      going to place on a company's offerings going forward. Buyers look for products
      to have some runway ahead of them in the product life cycle and not be rendered
      obsolete in the foreseeable future. Ideal products are distinctively different
      from their competitors, and have real sustainable competitive advantage, Knowing
      the value customers place on a company's offerings is a key driver in that company's
      ability to sell and generate cash. They understand that high value added products
      attract and retain more customers, and in many cases, high value allows for
      higher prices and stronger margins &mdash; while low value has the opposite
      effect.</p>\r\n<p>The degree to which offerings are differentiated, sustainable
      and competitive correlates directly with the degree of risk for the buyer, and
      risk correlates to their interest in the company and the price they are willing
      to pay.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>Based on your
      score in this section, [Company Name] falls into the bottom third ranking compared
      to where you should be in order to have high value as a possible acquisition
      candidate. Your offerings do not stand out as something a buyer could build
      upon as they take the company forward. This weakness creates a risk to a buyer
      that outweighs all other attributes [Company Name] may have.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>Buyers
      are going to view the weakness of your offerings as a fatal flaw for [Company
      Name]. You need to modify your offerings and/or the markets you serve, and the
      markets you are not currently serving. A truly objective look at your offerings
      and markets is a key first step to overcoming this weakness. Owners and business
      leaders often develop an emotional attachment to products, services and customers
      beyond their optimal time. Be certain to take an unemotional look at the business
      to move the offering in the right direction.</p>\r\n<p>Take an unemotional,
      objective look at your products and markets. Look for ways to apply your personal
      core strengths and the core strengths of your company differently. This could
      mean switching your operational knowledge and capabilities to another application
      and/or another market, either organically or through acquisition. It could also
      mean discarding the weaker parts of your offering and/or the weak portion of
      your customer base, and using the remainder as a platform to rebuild. Doing
      so could also allow you to cut your costs, improve processes, and jettison past
      mistakes.</p>"

      strong offerings provide the buyer with greater confidence when projecting sales,
      margins, and their resulting cash flow. As mentioned earlier, greater confidence
      equals reduced risk for the buyer, allowing them to present a more substantial
      offer.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>Although you enjoy strong offerings,
      it would be wise for you to put effort into further strengthening your offerings
      until you are ready to sell. While this should not be a priority, remember that
      buyers place significant importance on a company’s offerings; therefore, any
      effort and cost put into this area will be returned several times over as the
      enhanced value of your offerings are magnified by a higher sales multiple.  Be
      certain you understand and can clearly articulate your distinct product differentiation
      and sustainable competitive advantages.  If you can further strengthen them
      you will find even greater value in your business.</p>"

      alt=\"\" title=\"Sellability\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Background</h2>\r\n<p>Recurring
      and consistent revenue is extremely important. The level of risk in the customer
      base and the revenue stream can seriously detract from business valuation. Buyers
      will make this a key area of critical review. Buyers are looking for the impact
      of economic cycles, the risk to the business of losing customers or being overly
      dependent upon risky customers, markets, and sectors. For instance, a business
      highly dependent upon automotive customers who are impacted by widely swinging
      automotive business cycles has a lower value than customers in a stable, low
      variation industry such as a public utility or pharmaceuticals.</p>\r\n<p>Another
      big factor for any company is being dependent upon a small number of customers
      that make up a large percentage of your business. It is very risky and if a
      large customer is lost it can have a catastrophic impact on the company. The
      risk of losing a significant customer when transitioning ownership of a business
      is always very high. Many buyers hold the previous owner responsible and use
      earn outs or incentive programs to the seller based upon their commitment and
      ability to keep a customer after a sale.</p>\r\n<p>Major consideration is also
      given to diversity of the customer base. A multi-market customer base that is
      financially healthy is less risky than a single vertical market. Value and buyers
      look for a customer base that allows them to have consistent revenue and sales
      all year and from year to year. Without this balance, significant value is lost.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>[Company Name] has a poor customer situation
      ranking in the lower third of the index. The business is very dependent upon
      customers and markets that put the revenue stream at risk. This high-risk customer
      base will encourage a lower valuation. A typical buyer will assume losing business
      soon after buying the business]. It will make the valuation lower and even if
      earn outs and post transaction incentives are included in the valuation, they
      are rarely fully earned by a seller. This risk factor is very significant and,

      its business mode, and market strategy. Emphasis should be given to customer
      diversity, market and customer financial health and its sales processes to reshape
      the customer base. This is a long-term issue and may require several years to
      correct in order to lower the risk factor. Sometimes companies tend to have
      an emotional attachment to customers and business models that others would quickly
      change. Be sure to take an objective look at the situation (like the buyer will)
      to get an unemotional view.</p>"

      and consistent revenue is extremely important... The level of risk in the customer
      base and the revenue stream can seriously detract from business valuation. Buyers
      will make this a key area of critical review. Buyers are looking for the impact
      of economic cycles, the risk to the business of losing customers or being overly
      dependent upon risky customers, markets, and sectors. For instance, a business
      highly dependent upon automotive customers who are impacted by widely swinging
      automotive business cycles has a lower value than customers in a stable, low
      variation industry such as a public utility or pharmaceuticals.</p>\r\n<p>Another
      big factor for any company is being dependent upon a small number of customers
      that make up a large percentage of your business. It is very risky and if a
      large customer is lost it can have a catastrophic impact on the company. The
      risk of losing a significant customer when transitioning ownership of a business
      is always very high. Many buyers hold the previous owner responsible and use
      earn outs or incentive programs to the seller based upon their commitment and
      ability to keep a customer after a sale.</p>\r\n<p>Major consideration is also
      given to diversity of the customer base. A multi-market customer base that is
      financially healthy is less risky than a single vertical market. Value and buyers
      look for a customer base that allows them to have consistent revenue and sales
      all year and from year to year. Without this balance, significant value is lost.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>[Company Name] has a middle third ranking
      in its level of risk in its customer base. Although you may consider this similar
      to most companies, in reality there is still risk of losing some customers due
      to the company’s dependence on a higher risk customer situation and markets.
      The customer base lacks sufficient diversity to value it as a solid on-going
      revenue stream. A buyer will discount revenue and EBITDA for some factor of
      lost sales. As you will recall, this has a significant impact on EBITDA and
      the multiplier. A buyer will assume [Company Name] has an unstable revenue trend.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>Obviously
      [Company Name] needs to address their revenue risk issues. The business needs
      to make some customer base changes in order to reduce dependence on risky customers,
      build value and make the company more appealing in the marketplace and to potential
      buyers. You should start with an objective a customer base evaluation. [Company
      Name] needs to rethink its current market strategy and consider expanding or
      diversifying its markets. Emphasis should be given to customer diversity, market
      and customer financial health and its sales processes to reshape the customer

      Although a willing buyer will see some risk in the revenue stream, it still
      represents a reliable revenue stream going forward. The customer base shows
      the elements of diversity, stability and has limited dependence on risky customers
      or markets. Moreover, history appears to indicate that lost customer revenue
      is easily recovered with new business. Although [Company Name] could view this
      situation as an opportunity to take a little more risk and grab some business
      opportunistically for short-term gains, doing so will introduce a great deal
      of instability in the business and then detract from value. Care should be taken
      to not take on more risk and destroy value.</p>\r\n<p>Going forward [Company
      Name] needs to continually review its customer base to insure it maintains diversity
      and does not become dependent on risky customers. A normal product and business
      life cycle will cause [Company Name] to naturally move to a higher risk customer
      base. Objective and careful monitoring and control is needed to insure this
      good situation and company value is maintained. An objective, semi-annual or
      annual customer review with an eye to market trends and the health and future
      of that market is important. Be prepared to revise your business model and go
      to market strategies to stay ahead of the natural life-cycle curves.</p>"

      relative size and the growth trends of the markets in which you participate
      is a key factor, so are market share and the competitive environment. Having

      opportunity. However, if the market is dominated by one competitor, the growth
      potential and value are severely limited.</p>\r\n<p>Although at times it seems
      counter-intuitive, a market share so small that the company lacks critical mass
      to move forward and grow is a significant problem. It is as bad as when one
      single competitor controls the marketplace. A 15% share of served market is
      an indicator of critical mass in order to grow the business while a 65% market
      share is an indicator the company has limited growth potential in the same way
      a 65% single competitor market share limits the growth opportunity.</p>\r\n<p>A
      key to market share and growth potential is having a sustainable competitive
      advantage. Buyers will look for this in assessing value. Advantages over the
      competition, which competitors cannot easily duplicate, will be a big value
      driver. When your product or service has no significant advantage your revenue
      is again at risk and your growth potential is more limited. Although past performance
      is usually a great indicator of value and future value, without clear growth
      opportunity [Company Name] value will be significantly less than past performance
      would otherwise indicate.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>The
      competitive situation for [Company Name] indicates your growth opportunity and
      current revenue stream are at risk. Your competitive index in the lower third
      indicates that you cannot easily grow or expand without significant resources
      being spent to change or make a market shift and assure revenue growth. [Company
      Name] does not have a clear sustainable competitive advantage and is in an environment
      where the competitors have the upper hand. The competitive dynamic must change
      in order to build business value.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>To change
      the dynamic, [Company Name] should start by completing an objective competitive
      analysis and review to identify an alternative competitive approach and possibly
      your business model. Most companies are functionally in a confrontational competitive
      situation where there is no real advantage and from time to time each is merely
      able to get an upper hand and sustain it for relatively short periods. The solution
      that delivers value is to identify and pursue a true sustainable competitive
      advantage. Doing so will require a review of the customers and their use of
      the company’s product or service and all the major elements of the company to
      identify where and how to build a competitive advantage.</p>\r\n<p>It would
      be worthwhile for [Company Name] to review the five or six primary competitive
      strategies that can be pursued. This will help move the company away from the
      current confrontational strategy and to pursue a gorilla, niching or other more
      effective strategy. In addition some combination of a change in your business
      model, market served or product offering might be necessary to improve your
      competitive situation.</p>"

      sustainable for a long period of time, even if it is working reasonably well
      for the moment. Although [Company Name] has some growth opportunity it is limited
      and this hurts your valuation. A buyer will view your competitive situation
      as needing significant investment to make the business grow going forward and
      to change the competitive dynamic.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>A sustainable
      competitive advantage will add real value to [Company Name]. The solution should
      begin with re-examination of its product offering, customers and markets served,
      value chain and an objective competitive analysis. This may take outside help,
      some additional resources and time, but these are the same resources a buyer

      obvious &mdash; relying on a few large customers, or having all customers grouped
      in one or two market sectors is like having all your eggs in one basket. It
      presents great risk if a customer or a sector goes away.</p>\r\n<p>Last but

      even if the owner agrees to stay on in a sales role or through a transition
      period (which typically do not work out well), there is too much risk associated

      of not generating enough sales to sustain your business should one or two unexpected
      internal or external events occur.</p>\r\n<p>Being in the lower third means
      any buyer attention would come from a smaller pool. Interested buyers would
      most likely be strategic buyers such as local competitors trying to reduce their
      competition, or buyers located elsewhere with synergistic offerings who would
      like to expand their capabilities or move into your market location. Nevertheless,
      any offer coming your way could be moderately to heavily discounted. It should

      your weak marketing and sales process, you face a serious issue that requires
      immediate attention. We suggest that you first prioritize your deficiencies.

      true for the pool of financial buyers because they are more reliant on a robust,
      well-balanced process to generate sales.</p>\r\n<p>Although a weak marketing
      and sales process can be somewhat less important to a strategic buyer because
      they often have the ability to more quickly shore-up deficiencies in the process,
      they will still lower the value because they have to invest in it and know others

      [Company Name] already has some of the essential elements of an acceptable marketing
      and sales process, you would not be required to start over or make large structural
      changes to the process. However, we suggest that you make a concerted effort
      to improve the process. You will likely need a segmentation analysis and an
      objective look at your sales process. Although you may have some sales talent,
      this ranking indicates you may not have a robust process. Prioritize your deficiencies
      and then make improvements on a prioritized basis. Keep in mind that process
      changes like these require both determination and time to accomplish but fortunately,
      they do not necessarily require capital investment.</p>"

      way to improve the bottom line is to improve the top line. Since sales is the
      single most important indicator of success, buyers look for companies with a
      robust process to uncover sales leads and convert those leads into customers.
      Buyers like to see a sales process that has been proven effective through measured
      inputs and outputs, and one that is repeatedly followed. They also look for
      processes that are disciplined in maintaining contact with current and even
      past customers in order to secure repeat business.</p>\r\n<p>Buyers place significant
      importance on seeing sales spread across many customers rather than just a few,
      and they prefer to see customers from a mixture of market sectors rather than
      a concentration in one or two sectors. The reasons for these preferences are
      obvious &mdash; relying on a few large customers, or having all customers grouped
      in one or two market sectors is like having all your eggs in one basket. It
      presents great risk if a customer or a sector goes away.</p>\r\n<p>Last but
      not least, buyers tend to show little interest in companies when sales rest
      on the shoulders of the owner. Buyers understand that once a company is sold,
      even if the owner agrees to stay on in a sales role or through a transition
      period (which typically do not work out well), there is too much risk associated
      with a sales process based exclusively on owner/customer relationships and they
      will discount for this as lower revenue.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>Based
      on your score in this section, [Company Name] is in the top third ranking, making
      you attractive to a larger pool of buyers. In particular, it opens up a greater
      number of financial buyers who rely on an inherently strong marketing and sales
      process on the day they take over the business. You should not see a significant
      value reduction for sales and marketing.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>Because
      the marketing and sales process is quite important to buyers, we recommend you
      continue to fine-tune your process. Work on measuring the effectiveness of [Company
      Name] to uncover leads and effectively convert them to active customers. Make
      adjustments where opportunities exist. Remember that your sales price is some
      multiple of the cash you are generating, and nothing generates cash faster that
      improving sales. Therefore, your efforts to improve this process should pay
      you back multiple times.</p>"

      valuation for [Company Name] is directly related to the ability of the business
      to run without the owner. This does not mean for a day or a week but forever
      after the owner is gone. As the owner, if you leave the company for three months
      and it can continue to perform just as well without your involvement in that
      three-month period as it would have if you were involved, you can achieve reasonable
      value.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, other factors relating to the abilities and
      capabilities of your management team and key employees can potentially be significant
      value detractors from [Company Name]. Key among them is the longevity and runway
      ahead of your management team. Clearly, buying a business with experienced management
      that are all planning to retire in the next few years is just as risky as an
      inexperienced team. Business value comes from that perfect balance of age, experience
      and ability.</p>\r\n<p>Management must also be committed to [Company Name];
      otherwise the situation is considered dangerous and risky. A buyer will want
      them committed to contracts that include non-competes and limit the risk of
      trade secrets being exposed, competitors hiring your people, or key employees
      who become competitors themselves. In some severe situations where it is likely
      management will leave and become competitors after an ownership change, the
      business value will be zero. The risk will be judged too high.</p>\r\n<p>Another
      key value factor for [Company Name] is the level of tribal knowledge. Although
      we all value employees who know what they are doing, we do not want to have
      to depend on them as the only ones who know how to do things. Documented process
      for doing things in the business is another major value driver. In this way
      there is little risk should you lose a key employee. Buyers focus heavily on
      this documentation and consider a business reliant on key people and lacking
      documentation of key processes as very risky. They will make a big discount
      of value for these factors. It does not matter if it is a strategic or financial
      buyer; both will need the same confidence in management, people and commitment.
      The only difference is the length of time they need them.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company
      Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>Like many privately held businesses [Company
      Name] has a level of owner involvement and dependence that is very high placing
      them in the lower third on the index. Although it may feel like the company
      has a good team and has delegated tasks to them, the owner is still very involved
      in daily activities and the business cannot stand on its own without them and
      without some key employees. The processes of [Company Name] are not well enough
      documented to ensure the business can continue to run well. This limits value
      in that a new owner may not be able to step in and be successful right away.
      A potential buyer will need significant time and money to replace what the owner
      knows. Further, this reflects badly on the [Company Name] management team indicating
      they are not the reliable team to carry the business forward, which translates
      to even more risk for the buyer.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>An objective,
      critical evaluation of the [Company Name] management team, internal processes
      and documentation is necessary to move forward. A full review considering longevity,
      runway for the team, the level of process documentation and your employment
      contracts and agreements is necessary. This review may take as much as two to
      three years to maximize the value of the management team. Keep in mind, the
      balance of longevity and runway are both important so presenting a business
      with a young management team and six months experience may reduce value as much
      or even more than a team with little runway.</p>\r\n<p>If and when [Company
      Name] goes on the market, the business and management team will face a completely
      new set of issues. Both the business and management will be spotlighted and
      intensely evaluated. Care should be taken to secure the management team with
      stay packages through the sale process as well as good coaching provided by
      experienced people so they can hold up well and properly show their capabilities
      and abilities to a buyer.</p>"

      Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>Although the [Company Name] can run without
      the owner for periods of time, it is still very dependent upon a one or two
      people for success. While this level of owner involvement is common for owner-led
      businesses, it is still a value reduction. With only some processes documented,
      [Company Name] needs to document more in order to insure it is not too dependent
      on key employees and can still serve all customers well without them. Just the
      same, a new owner will still view the purchase of [Company Name] as risky due
      to this dependence on the owner and key people and will discount significantly
      for all the cost of building documentation and risk associated with not having
      it.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>[Company Name] needs to review and
      consider improvement in the management team. There are issues relating to their
      capability, commitment and runway. The company needs to insure they have tight
      employment agreements keeping them from becoming competitors to a new owner
      and perhaps have good reasons to stay with them. Money spent to insure your
      management team is tied up should also include stay packages for transition.
      Once you document your processes and reduce dependence upon the owner, what
      you spend will be returned to you in a much higher business valuation. If and
      when [Company Name] goes on the market, the business and management team will
      face a completely new set of issues. Both will be spotlighted and intensely
      evaluated. Care should be taken to prepare the management team for the sale
      process as well as good coaching provided by experienced people so they can
      hold up well and properly show their capabilities and abilities to a buyer.</p>"

      have a management team that is capable and reliable and uses documented processes.
      Be sure to look at their runway and commitment to the business. As capable as
      they may be, it also could put [Company Name] or a new owner at risk of key

      an employment agreement from EBITDA and lower the purchase price significantly.

      owners must understand that to a buyer, assets only have value to the extent

      asset. As such, the value of [Company Name] is directly impacted by the quality
      of the work force. These human resource elements are a key valuation factor
      and can cause dramatic swings in valuation. Buyers recognize that over time
      employees become more productive, learn the business and are better able to
      add value and contribute to the company’s overall success. That is not to say
      a business should only have long tenured employees because value is only sustainable
      with a diverse age range. Buyers also recognize that if all the employees retire
      during a very short period of time, the knowledge and experience going out the
      door could simply put you out of business or certainly cause severe damage to
      the business in the near term.</p>\r\n<p>Value comes from good morale and good
      discipline which translates into low employee turnover as opposed to no employee
      turnover. It also comes from diversity in the work force including their age
      range.</p>\r\n<p>An ideal company has diversity, a moderate average age, reasonable
      experience and tenure as well as good human resource management. This means
      a proven and repeatable hiring process, a successful safety program and safety
      record, an employee handbook with good discipline procedures that are adhered
      to, little or no history of or risk of employee related claims against the company.
      The presence of, or the risk of, a union is an obvious value detractor but depending
      upon the region of the country and nature of the union, it could have a varying
      valuation impact.</p>\r\n<h2>[Company Name] Current Position</h2>\r\n<p>The
      [Company Name] human resource situation is in the lower third. It will be perceived
      as risky and reduces its value. Your employee turnover, age factors and overall
      people situation is in need of repair. The score and data indicate that you
      will be perceived to have fairly poor morale and people problems. It is likely
      that meaningful performance management is absent, policies and procedures are
      not being followed and the handbook is not up to date or evenly applied.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>Since
      the sources of employee problems are usually not found in only one area, an
      objective and complete review of the people situation is the best solution.
      To improve the situation, policies and procedures need to be fully reviewed
      by an objective outsider. .The review should include employee manuals, hiring
      policies, work rules, employee goals and objectives and any measurements used
      in the company. This should be augmented by employee interviews and possibly
      surveys. As a result of this process, [Company Name] will need to put policies,
      procedures and practices in place to begin to improve the poor human resource
      situation.</p>\r\n<p>Special review and attention will be needed to reduce or
      eliminate your risk of litigation and future problems for you or a buyer. It
      cannot be fixed overnight and several years will be required to show the right
      diversity, age, turnover and risk ratios to insure your human resource issues
      are not a major value deduction. A big risk is that a poor human resource situation
      will reflect poorly on other areas of the business such as sales, products,
      the management team and other value factors resulting in a dramatic value reduction.</p>"

      [Company Name] employee ratios indicate the company is in the middle third and

      right elements are in place and you have human resources practices that are
      reasonable overall, there are still some remaining problems which may well be
      reflected in morale and productivity issues. A big risk is that, whether real
      or perceived, it will become a serious area of contention and reflect poorly
      on other value factors including your management team, sales and product situation.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>The
      best starting point for [Company Name] to correct the problem and preserve value
      is to objectively review its policies, manuals and overall hiring practices.
      An outsider should conduct the review and also interview or survey employees.
      As a result of the review, [Company Name] can fully understand the areas that
      are in need of correction. Focus should be on insuring improvement and sustainability
      in your employee ratios, diversity in the workforce and minimizing the turnover
      of experienced employees. It is likely you have some litigation risks which
      need to be mitigated to insure continued good financial performance and low
      risk for a potential buyer.</p>"

      needs of your customers and your approach does not highlight any value unique
      to your product/service.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, there is no real focus on demand
      generation in your organization. There is no effort being made to determine
      which approach makes sense and the results are proof that this is a serious
      problem for your company. The leads are all viewed equally regardless of cost,
      approach or conversion rates. This means that you are not certain that you are
      effectively or efficiently generating the number or quality that you can. In
      addition, you really have no idea which of your messages is having the greatest
      impact.</p>\r\n<p>There appears to be no effort to analyze sales difficulties
      other than as a problem with the sales force. Too much effort is being spent
      on that aspect without trying to make your product easier to sell with the sales
      force you have.</p>\r\n<p>Little or no attention is being paid to assure customer
      loyalty. The organization believes that as long as they are doing good work
      that is sufficient to maintain loyalty.</p>\r\n<p>Your organization is placing
      little or no effort on soliciting references or referrals. There is no enforced
      discipline to extract either from your customer base. This is leaving you vulnerable
      to competition and losing a great opportunity to acquire new customers.</p>\r\n<p>Areas
      to look for improvement:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>More emphasis as to the unique
      benefits your products offer is needed. Although your product functionality
      and features are robust and well communicated it is value that customers purchase.</li>\r\n\t<li>A
      much better analysis of lead generation and qualification is sorely needed.
      The number and quality of leads is a measurable item and critical to increasing
      revenue and reducing costs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Integrating the business model and
      the sales process needs to be constantly evaluated. Most revenue problems are
      not the problem of the sales force. Except for a few instances revenue problems
      can be directly traced back to a problem with the business model or a poor process
      of hiring, training, managing or coaching. No sales force fails except that
      some manager has also failed.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>Consider some of the
      following techniques to improve customer loyalty.</p>\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Calling
      at the right customer levels with the commensurate levels within your organizations</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Regular
      product updates</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Regular surveys of customer needs</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Social
      networking</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Occasional added value offerings</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Asking
      for a report card</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t<p>There are many other ways this
      can be accomplished but a documented system of customer relationship management
      is the easiest way to be certain that nothing falls through the cracks.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Every
      customer should be a reference and if they will not be a reference the reason
      should be known and every effort should be made to remedy any problem. Try offering
      marketing events with your best customers as co-sponsors and/or presenters.

      that are producing the best results. You have a grasp on which generation approach
      is generating the greatest number of leads but that’s about all. There is no

      grasp the fact that it’s easier to upgrade the existing sales force and have
      done a reasonable job of training, coaching and mentoring but haven't focused

      For example:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>In the area of product benefits and unique
      value proposition emphasize in concrete terms how your product is faster, better
      or cheaper. Tying benefits back to a dollar benefit is always the best way to
      convey value.</li>\r\n\t<li>Continuing to look for more effective lead generation
      should be a constant focus of the sales organization. As new approaches arise
      learn if they can add to number of leads, the conversion rate and the dollar
      value.</li>\r\n\t<li>Remember that the business model validation comes first.
      Assessing it and how future technological, economic or industry developments
      will impact it should be an annual evaluation as an annual health exam for the
      business.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your efforts at maintaining customer loyalty needs to
      be more consistent. A quarterly review with your best customers with regard
      to their satisfaction with your performance might be a well advised program
      to implement.</li>\r\n\t<li>You need more documented references and more referral
      efforts are also needed. Every customer needs to be a reference and those not
      willing to be a reference need to be questioned as to why.</li>\r\n</ol>"
